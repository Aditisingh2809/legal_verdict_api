Supreme_Court_2022_1063,"RAVINDRA BHAT, J.Special leave granted.The appellant (husband of the is aggrieved by his conviction under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the imposed on him.His appeal, against the conviction and in respect of that offence, was by the impugned judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court.The prosecution alleged that on at A.M., information was from the hospital that a woman had been brought there by her husband (the appellant) in a burnt condition.At the request of Police Station Ashok Nagar District Ashoknagar, Guna, M.P, the medico legal certificate (MLC) of the injured Pushpa Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by SNEHA DAS Date 130543 IST was issued.Her dying declaration was recorded.Reason On some burnt clothes smelling of oil, one chimani, one broken smelling of oil, a match box with Anand 3-4 match sticks were seized.A spot map too, was prepared.of were recorded.The injured Pushpa succumbed to her injuries on in the district hospital, Guna.A post-mortem was conducted.The seized articles were sent for FSL.Police, after completing the filed the charge sheet against the Appellants for offence under Sections 302, 307, 304B, 498A/34 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under Section 3 and 4 of the Dowry Act.The trial court, by order dated framed charges under Sections 498A, 302 or in the alternative 304B of IPC against the Santi Bai, whereas framed charges under Sections 498A, 304B of IPC against remaining accused, namely the appellant, Ram Singh, Kamla Bai and Susheela Bai Halki.The accused pleaded not guilty.The prosecution examined 15 Susheela Bai Halki had appeared before the trial court and absented herself she was declared absconding and a perpetual warrant of arrest was issued.The trial court, by the impugned judgments, convicted and Santi Bai for the offence under Section 302 IPC and the appellant and other accused for the offence under Section 498A IPC.The appellant and the other accused challenged their conviction and The High Court, by the impugned order, their appeals.Consequently, the appellants conviction and under Section 498A IPC was affirmed.Mr. Divyakant Lahoti, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant urged that the courts below fell into in relying on the dying declaration by the his wife.It was argued that where a is made by a person as to the cause of her death or as to any of the of the transaction resulting in death, that would be admissible.It was argued that hence, allegations made by the against the accused, i.e., the appellant in her dying declaration would be as they were not of the of the transaction which resulted in her death.It was next submitted that Dashrath Raikwar (P.W.1), the brother Phool Chandra (P.W.2), the father (P.W.3), the sister and (P.W.4) the brother-in-law did not support the prosecution version about cruelty inflicted upon her.In the the appellants conviction is unsustainable.Learned counsel also urged that the courts below fell into in not giving weight to the contradictions the so-called dying declarations, Ex.P-11 and Ex.P-26.It was submitted that the testimonies of PW-7, who recorded Ex.P-11 and PW-10, the doctor, are and improbable with respect to the time to the document.the later declaration Ex.P-26 is it was not recorded by securing clearance from any doctor about the conscious state of the late Pushpa.Given the fact that all material who could have alleged cruelty, relating to dowry demands, except the appellant, were named in Ex.P-11, the inclusion of the appellant, in the later dying declaration (Ex.P-26) is The absence of the doctor when the was recorded and the fact that the appellant was not named for the first dying declaration, but in the second declaration renders both the dying declarations It was submitted that the High Court, in fact, the second dying declaration.It was lastly urged on behalf of the appellant that since the prosecution could not prove the charge on the count under Section 304B, he could not have been convicted on the basis of the dying declaration, because Section 32 of the Evidence Act renders relevant only relating to the surrounding the death of the person making it and that in the present case, the only dying declaration, Ex.P-11 nowhere mentions any act of cruelty to the appellant.On behalf of the state, it was argued by Mr. Yashraj Singh Bundela, learned counsel, that no with the concurrent findings of the courts below is called for and that the appeal involves appreciation of As there is nothing that can be termed as or unreasonable as regards these findings, which are based on the led, this court should not its discretionary to upset or with the findings.It was submitted that the fact that the turned hostile may no doubt be a relevant aspect.Yet, this has to be weighed in with other factors, the most important being the dying declaration recorded as Ex.P-26.Counsel submitted that the first dying declaration, i.e., Ex.P-11 listed the actual of the crime, which is those responsible for dousing the with and setting her on fire, whereas Ex.P-26 contained details of the cruelty meted out to her since she had a and had a girl child.These and the people who treated her cruelly, taunted her, and dowry were all named.They included the appellant, her husband.There was close proximity the first and second It was submitted that the absence of any by a doctor about the mental condition, or fitness to record the or that it was recorded by a policeman cannot ipso facto result in its being ruled out.Analysis and Findings As can be gathered from the factual the incident, i.e., setting of the on fire, her subsequently being moved to the hospital, where two were recorded, one by the Naib Tehsildar, certified by the doctor, and the other, a recorded by the police, are crucial for consideration in this case.In the dying declaration, Ex.P-11 recorded by PW-7, after the victim was examined by the doctor, the mentioned the surrounding the Incident, i.e., how she was burnt I was sitting in the courtyard in the morning.Fighting was taking place.My both elder (Jethani) were fighting.There was big adi, had poured oil one from it.My (Jethani) Kiran and Shanti poured oil upon me and set me on fire from the match stick.My elder mother-in law was seeing by standing just there.My mother-in-law as not at home.My husband was out of the house.Later, during the course of recording of the declaration, she also stated There are two Jeth, actually they are three Jeth, there are two mothers-in-law, the name of third Jethani is Sushila.She was not at home at that time.She used to fight and beat up me.My younger son is 6-7 months old.All used to beat.Mother-in law also used to beat up me.All the three Jeths used to fight with me.They called me lame.They used to demand dowry from me.The recording of Ex.P-11 started at 1035 and ended at 1050.The appellant sought to make out a contradiction the of However, this court is unpersuaded that such contradiction is material.From the it appears that the second Ex.P-26 was recorded later by PW-15, the Officer in charge.After stating the under which the incident occurred- which were consistent with the contents of Ex.P-11, the further stated .I started burning and cried for saving me then they both fled away by leaving me burnt, then Dukra, my elder father-in-law by coming saved me, he died out the fire by throwing water on me.I have burnt up completely.Full clothes on my body have burnt.My face, breast, thigh, legs, hands have completely burnt.I am feeling very much pain.Then my husband and neighbouring persons have brought me to Ashok nagar for I had become unconscious at that time.My in-laws, husband, elder brothers-in-law Beeran, Halle alias Ramsingh, Praansingh alias elder Sushila, Kiranbai, Shantibai and mother in- law often by taunting for dowry used to beat up me for dowry demand.They used to tease me by calling lame.They used to demand rupees, motorcycle in dowry.These people had beaten up me last night also which I had told to my younger sister over phone and that my condition is bad.Section 32 of the Evidence Act, which is material for the purposes of this appeal, reads as under Cases in which of relevant fact by person who is dead or cannot be found, etc., is relevant.-- written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or which under the of the case appears to the Court unreasonable, are relevant facts in the following cases -- When it relates to cause of death.--When the is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of the of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that persons death comes into question.Such are relevant whether the person who made them was or was not, at the time when they were made, under expectation of death, and whatever may be the nature of the proceeding in which the cause of his death comes into question.Or is made in course of the was made by such person in the ordinary course of and in particular when it of any entry or made by him in books kept in the ordinary course of or in the discharge of professional duty or of an acknowledgment written or signed by him of the receipt of money, goods, securities or property of any kind or of a document used in commerce written or signed by him or of the date of a letter or other document usually dated, written or signed by him.Or against interest of maker.--When the is against the pecuniary or interest of the person making it, or when, if true, it would expose him or would have exposed him to a criminal prosecution or to a suit for damages.Or gives opinion as to public right or custom, or matters of general the gives the opinion of any such person, as to the of any public right or custom or matter of public or general interest, of the of which, if it existed, he would have been likely to be aware, and when such was made before any controversy as to such right, custom or matter had arisen.Or relates to of relationship.--When the relates to the of any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption persons as to whose relationship by blood, marriage or adoption the person making the had special means of knowledge, and when the was made before the question in dispute was raised.Or is made in will or deed relating to family affairs.--When the relates to the of any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption persons and is made in any will or deed relating to the affairs of the family to which any such person belonged, or in any family or upon any tombstone, family portrait or other thing on which such are usually made, and when such was made before the question in dispute was raised.Or in document relating to transaction mentioned in Section 13, clause (a).--When the is contained in any deed, will or other document which relates to any such transaction as is mentioned in Section 13, clause (a).Or is made by several persons and feelings relevant to matter in question.--When the was made by a number of persons, and feelings or on their part relevant to the matter in question.This court has considered the above provision in numerous decisions and held that the weight and utility of a dying declaration depend upon the surrounding and the which the court attaches to it, having regard to the led before it.whether it is essential to have medical before the is recorded, who records it, etc.are all fact and no stereotypical approach can be adopted by courts.In Laxman vs. State of a Bench of this court explained the position, in law, as follows A dying declaration can be oral or in writing and in any adequate method of communication whether by words or by signs or otherwise will suffice provided the is positive and definite.12002 (SUPP1) SCR 697 In most cases, however, such are made orally before death ensues and is reduced to writing by someone like a magistrate or a doctor or a police officer.When it is recorded, no oath is necessary nor is the of a magistrate is absolutely necessary, although to assure it is usual to call a magistrate, if for recording the of a man about to die.There is no of law that a dying declaration must necessarily be made to a magistrate and when such is recorded by a magistrate there is no specified form for such recording.Consequently, what evidential value or weight has to be attached to such necessarily depends on the facts and of each particular case.What is essentially required is that the person who records a dying declaration must be satisfied that the was in a fit state of mind.Where it is proved by the testimony of the magistrate that the declarant was fit to make the even without examination by the doctor the declaration can be acted upon provided the court ultimately holds the same to be voluntary and truthful.A by the doctor is essentially a rule of caution and the voluntary and truthful nature of the declaration can be established otherwise.In a decision, Lakhan v. State of Madhya Pradesh,2 this court considered and indicated the approach which may be adopted, where the includes multiple dying declarations, that may contain facts In view of the above, the law on the issue of dying declaration can be summarised to the effect that in case the court comes to the conclusion that the dying declaration is true and reliable, has been recorded by a person at a time when the was fit physically and mentally to make the declaration and it has not been made under any tutoring duress prompting it can be the sole basis for recording conviction.In such an eventuality no is required.In case there are multiple dying declarations and there are them, generally, the dying declaration recorded by the higher officer like a Magistrate can be relied upon, provided that there is no giving rise to any suspicion about its truthfulness.In case there are wherein the declaration had been made, not voluntarily and even otherwise, it is not supported by the other the court has to scrutinise the facts of an case very carefully and take a decision as to which of the declarations is worth reliance.Recently, in Jagbir Singh v State of NCT Delhi,3 this court several previous decisions involving multiple dying declarations and re-stated the law in these terms 22010 (9) SCR 705 3 (2019) 8 SCC 779 A survey of the decisions would show that the principles can be culled out as follows Conviction of a person can be made solely on the basis of a dying declaration which inspires confidence of the court If there is nothing about the declaration, no may be necessary No doubt, the court must be satisfied that there is no tutoring or prompting The court must also analyse and come to the conclusion that of the was not at play in making the declaration.In this regard, the court must look to the entirety of the language of the dying declaration Considering material before it, both in the form of oral and documentary the court must be satisfied that the version is compatible with the reality and the truth as can be gleaned from the facts established However, there may be cases where there are more than one dying declaration.If there are more than one dying declaration, the dying declarations may entirely agree with one another.There may be dying declarations where the declarations The extent of the would then have to be considered by the court.The may turn out to be reconciliable.In such cases, where the go to some matter of detail or description but is in nature as far as the Accused is concerned, the court would look to the material on record to conclude as to which dying declaration is to be relied on unless it be shown that they are unreliable The third category of cases is that where there are more than one dying declaration and the declarations are absolute and the dying declarations are irreconcilable being repugnant to one another.In a dying declaration, the Accused may not be blamed at all and the cause of death may be placed at the doorstep of an unfortunate accident.This may be followed up by another dying declaration which is diametrically opposed to the first dying declaration.In fact, in that scenario, it may not be a question of an dying declaration but a dying declaration which is completely opposed to the dying declaration which is given earlier.There may be more than two.In the third scenario, what is the duty of the court?Should the court, without looking into anything else, conclude that in view of complete the second or the third dying declaration which is relied on by the prosecution is demolished by the earlier dying declaration or dying declarations or is it the duty of the court to carefully attend to not only the dying declarations but examine the rest of the materials in the form of placed before the court and still conclude that the dying declaration is capable of being relied upon?In light of the above principles, it is necessary to consider the evidentiary value of the dying declaration, which was relied on by the prosecution to convict the appellant.The trial court had relied upon the such as the of the nature of burn injuries on the the articles such as match box which smelt of and a broken apart from two dying declarations (Ex.P-11 and Ex.P-26).The testimonies of the relatives were not of much as none of them supported the prosecution.The High Court, in its impugned judgment, accepted and relied upon the dying declaration recorded by PW-7 (Ex.P-11), Naib Tehsildar Yasha Rai.However, the High Court held that the second dying declaration recorded by the Officer-in-Charge, PW-15 in the form of a could not be relied upon.The court was of the opinion that even though PW-15 was not required to obtain fitness certificate from the doctor, yet in view of the last line in the dying that her condition was bad, it was unsafe to rely on such a police The High Courts findings on this aspect are as follows Before considering the made by the Counsel for the Appellants, this Court would like to consider as to whether the police of the injured Pushpa, Ex.P.26 is reliable or not?As already pointed out, S.K.Chaturvedi (P.W.15), who had recorded Police of injured Pushpa, was not examined after the of Appellant Susheela Bai Halki, and as of S.K.Chaturvedi (P.W.15) was recorded in absence of Susheela Bai Halki, his cannot be read either in favor or against the Appellant Susheela Bai Halki.Thus, there is only one dying declaration, Ex.P.11 against the Appellant Susheela Bai Halki.S.K.Chaturvedi (P.W.15) has stated that he had recorded the of the including that of injured Pushpa.If the police of injured Pushpa is considered then at the end of the it is mentioned that her condition is very bad.it is not clear as to whether the injured Pushpa was in a fit state of mind or not.Even otherwise, this witness has not clarified that on what date he had recorded the of injured Pushpa.It is true that while recording the police under Section 161 of this witness was not required to obtain the fitness certificate from the Doctor, but in view of the last line of her that her condition is very bad, this Court is of the considered opinion, that it would not be safe to rely on the Police of the injured Pushpa, Ex.P.26.Accordingly, the Police of the injured Pushpa Bai, Ex.P.26 is hereby The principles enunciated by the decision of this court, especially Laxman and the decisions dealing with multiple dying declarations, in the course of a criminal trial, especially where the had been a victim of burns and had succumbed to burn injuries and had prior to death made more than one dying declaration have indicated that test of having regard to the overall facts on record, has to be adopted.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Supreme_Court_2023_730,"BELA M. TRIVEDI, J.This batch of five Review Petitions seeks to review the common Judgment and Order dated passed by this Court in Civil Appeal No.1661 of 2020 and Civil Appeal No.2568 of 2020.Both the said appeals were by the State Tax Officer-appellant.Civil Appeal No.1661 of 2020 was by the Tax Officer against the Papers Limited (Corporate Debtor), being aggrieved by the Judgment and Order dated passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal to as the NCLAT), the Company Appeal (At) (INs) No.404 of 2019 filed by the appellant.The said company Appeal was filed against the order dated passed by the Adjudicating Authority, rejecting the Application being I.A.No.of 2018 and P-01/2019 in CP No.(IB) 88/9/NCLT AHM/2017 filed by the appellants, in which it was held that the appellant cannot claim first charge over the property of the Corporate Debtor, as Section 48 of the Gujarat Value Tax 2003 to as the GVAT Act) cannot prevail over Section 53 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 to as the IBC).Civil Appeal No.2568 of 2020 was by the appellant- State Tax Officer against the Respondents- Mr. Chandra Prakash Jain and M s. Mekaster Ltd., being aggrieved by the Order dated passed by the NCLAT in Company Appeal (At) (Ins) No.1193 of 2019.The NCALT by the said judgment and order had the said Appeal of the appellant on the basis of the judgment and order dated passed in Company Appeal (At) (Insolvency No.404 of 2019) (which was the order under challenge in Civil Appeal No.1661 of 2020).This Court while allowing the said Appeals vide the impugned order dated held as under Section 48 of the GVAT Act is not contrary to or with Section 53 or any other provisions of the IBC.Under Section the debts owed to a secured creditor, which would include the State under the GVAT Act.are to rank equally with other specified debts including debts on account of workmans dues for a period of 24 months preceding the date.As observed above, the State is a secured creditor under the GVAT Act.Section 3(30) of the IBC defines secured creditor to mean a creditor in favour of whom security interest is credited.Such security interest could be created by operation of law.The of secured creditor in the IBC does not exclude any Government or Governmental Authority.We are constrained to hold that the Appellate Authority (NCLAT) and the Adjudicating Authority erred in law in rejecting the application appeal of the appellant.As observed above, delay in filing a claim cannot be the sole ground for rejecting the claim.The appeals are allowed.The impugned orders are set aside.The Resolution plan approved by the CoC is also set aside.The Resolution Professional may consider a fresh Resolution Plan in the light of the observations made above.However, this judgment and order will not, prevent the Resolution Applicant from submitting a plan in the light of the observations made above, making provisions for the dues of the creditors like the appellant.There shall be no order as to costs.The following five Review Petitions have been filed by the Review Petitioners being aggrieved by the said common judgment and order dated passed by this Court.The Review Petition (Civil) No.1620 of 2023 in Civil Appeal No.1661 of 2020 has been filed by the petitioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, who happened to be the Liquidator of Biotor Industries Limited (previously known as Jayant Oils and Derivatives Private Limited) (Corporate Debtor) a dealer under the Gujarat Value Tax 2003 Act to as the GVAT Act) and the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 to as the Sales Tax Act).The Review Petitioner was not a party to the proceedings of Civil Appeal No.1661 of 2020, however, has filed the Review Petition claiming to be an aggrieved person on the ground that the impugned order dated passed by this Court would have direct effect on the proceedings pending the Review Petitioner and the Gujarat Sales Tax Authority before the Gujarat High Court in Special Civil Application No.23256 of 2019.The Review Petition No.1621 of 2023 in Civil Appeal No.1661 of 2020 has been filed by the Review Petitioner Choudhary, who happened to be the Resolution Professional to as the RP) of the Corporate Debtor, Rainbow Papers Limited and was the respondent in the proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal to as the NCLT) in Application No.P-01 of 2019 in CP No.88/9/NCLT AHM/2017 and was respondent no.2 before the NCLAT in Company Appeal (At) (Ins) No.404 of 2019).According to the Review Petitioner, he was not made party in the Civil Appeal No.1661 of 2020 filed before this Court and was aggrieved by the said order.The Review Petition (Civil) No.1622 of 2023 in Civil Appeal No.1661 of 2020 has been filed by the Review Petitioner State Bank of India, on behalf of the Consortium of lenders of the Biotor Industries Limited, a company under The Review petitioner was not a party to the proceedings of Civil Appeal No.1661 of 2020, however, claims to be an aggrieved person as according to the Review Petitioner, the impugned judgment had an effect over the proceedings pending the Review Petitioner and the Sales Tax authorities, in Writ Petition being SCA No.23256 of 2019 before the Gujarat High Court.The Review Petition (Civil) No.236 of 2023 in Civil Appeal No.2568 of 2020 has been filed by the Review Petitioners Chandra Prakash Jain and Anr., Resolution Professional of M s. Mekaster Ltd., and M s. Mekaster Ltd (Corporate Debtor), who were the respondents in Civil Appeal No.2568 of 2020 filed by the Appellant State Tax Officer.According to the petitioners, they are aggrieved by the common impugned order dated passed by this Court as the same was passed without taking into consideration the law laid down by this Court and the provisions of IBC.The Review Petition (Civil) No.1623 of 2023 in Civil Appeal No.1661 of 2020 has been filed by the Review Petitioner- Indian Overseas Bank, which was one of the members of the Committee of creditors subsequent to the of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) of the M s. Rainbow Papers Limited (Corporate Debtor).The Review Petitioner was not a party to the proceedings in Civil Appeal No.1661 of 2020, however, is seeking review being aggrieved by the impugned judgment dated This Court vide the order dated 13 th November, had allowed the Applications seeking permission to file Review Petitions and also allowed the applications seeking Impleadment.Scope of Review At the outset, it may be stated that the power to review its judgments has been conferred on the Supreme Court by Article 137 of the of India.Of course, that power is subject to the provisions of any law made by the Parliament or the Rules made under Article 145.Supreme Court in of the powers conferred under Article 145 of the of India has framed the Supreme Court Rules, 2013.The Order XLVII of Part IV thereof deals with the provisions of Review.Accordingly, in a Civil Proceeding, an application for review is only on the grounds mentioned in Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and in a Criminal Proceeding on the ground of an apparent on the face of record.However, it may be noted that neither Order XLVII CPC nor Order XLVII of Supreme Court Rules limits the remedy of review only to the parties to the judgment under review.Even a third party to the proceedings, if he considers himself to be an aggrieved person, may take recourse to the remedy of review petition.The is that the person should be aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by this Court in some respect.1 In view of the said legal position, the Review Petitioners who claimed to be the aggrieved persons by the impugned judgment dated were permitted to file Review Petitions and were heard by the Court.Before adverting to the raised by the learned counsels for the parties, let us regurgitate the well settled law on the scope of 1 (2019) 18 SCC 586, Union of India vs. Nareshkumar Badrikumar Jagad Others review as contemplated in Order XLVII of the Supreme Court Rules read with Order XLVII of CPC.In the words of Krishna Iyer J., (as His Lordship then was) a plea of review, unless the first judicial view is manifestly distorted, is like asking for the Moon.A forensic defeat cannot be avenged by an to have a second look, hopeful of discovery of flaws and reversal of result A review in the Counsels mentation cannot repair the verdict once given.So, the law laid down must rest in peace.2 It is also well settled that a party is not entitled to seek a review of a judgment by this Court merely for the purpose of a rehearing and a fresh decision of the case.The normal principle is that a judgment pronounced by the Court is final, and departure from that principle is justified only when of a substantial and compelling character make it necessary to do so.3 In Parsion Devi and Others vs. Sumitri Devi and Others 4, this Court made very pivotal observations - Under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC a judgment may be open to review inter alia if there is a mistake or an apparent on the face of the record.An which is not and has to be by a process of reasoning, can hardly be 2 (1980) 2 SCC 167, M s. Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. vs. Lt.Governor of Delhi 3 AIR 1965 SC 845, Sajjan Singh and Ors.vs. State of and Ors.4 (1997) 8 SCC 715 said to be an apparent on the face of the record justifying the court to its power of review under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.In of the under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC it is not permissible for an erroneous decision to be reheard and corrected.A review petition, it must be has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be an appeal in disguise.Again, in Shanti Conductors Private Limited vs. Assam State Electricity Board and Others5, a three Judge Bench of this Court following Parsion Devi and Others vs. Sumitri Devi and Others (supra) the review petitions holding that the scope of review is limited and under the guise of review, the petitioner cannot be permitted to reagitate and reargue the questions which have already been and Recently, in Shri Ram Sahu (Dead) Through Legal and Others vs. Vinod Kumar Rawat and Others 6, this Court restated the law with regard to the scope of review under Section 114 read with Order XLVII of CPC.In R.P.(C) Nos.1273-1274 of 2021 in Civil Appeal Nos.8345- 8346 of 2018 (Arun Dev vs.Integrated Sales Service Limited Another), this Court the law and held that - From the above, it is evident that a power to review cannot be as an appellate power and has to be 5 (2020) 2 SCC 677 6 (2021) 13 SCC 1 strictly confined to the scope and ambit of Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC.An on the face of record must be such an which, mere looking at the record should strike and it should not require any long-drawn process of reasoning on the points where there may conceivably be two opinions.It is very pertinent to note that recently the Bench in Beghar Foundation vs. Justice K.S.Puttaswamy (Retired) and Others , held that even the change in law or subsequent decision judgment of co-ordinate Bench or larger Bench by itself cannot be regarded as a ground for review.The gist of the afore-stated decisions is that - A judgment is open to review inter alia if there is a mistake or an apparent on the face of the record.A judgment pronounced by the Court is final, and departure from that principle is justified only when of a substantial and compelling character make it necessary to do so.An which is not and has to be by a process of reasoning, can hardly be said to be an apparent on the face of record justifying the court to its power of review.7 (2021) 3 SCC 1 In of the under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC, it is not permissible for an erroneous decision to be reheard and corrected.A Review Petition has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be an appeal in disguise.Under the guise of review, the petitioner cannot be permitted to reagitate and reargue the questions which have already been and An on the face of record must be such an which, mere looking at the record should strike and it should not require any long-drawn process of reasoning on the points where there may conceivably be two opinions.Even the change in law or subsequent decision judgment of a co-ordinate or larger Bench by itself cannot be regarded as a ground for review.Analysis Keeping in view the afore-stated legal position, let us examine whether the Review Petitioners have been able to make out any case within the ambit of Order XLVII of Supreme Court Rules, read with Order XLVII of CPC, for reviewing the impugned judgment.We have heard Mr. Harish N Salve, Mr. Naveen Pahwa, Mr. Dhruv Mehta, Mr. Ramji Srinivasan, Mr. Siddharth and Mr. Sumesh Dhawan, learned Senior Counsels and other learned counsels for the Review Petitioners Intervenors, as also Mr. Maninder Singh, learned Senior Counsel and Ms. Aastha Mehta, learned Counsel for the Respondents.The learned Senior Counsels and learned Counsels for the Review Petitioners Intervenors placing heavy reliance on the observations made by a two Judge Bench of this Court in C.A.No.7976 of 2019 (Paschim Anchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited vs. Raman Ispat Private Limited and Others), on 17th July, 2023, submitted that the court in the impugned judgment had failed to consider the waterfall mechanism contained in Section 53, as also failed to consider other provisions of the IBC.They have relied upon the observations made by the co-ordinate Bench in the following - Rainbow Papers (supra) did not notice the waterfall mechanism under Section 53 the provision had not been adverted to or extracted in the judgment.Rainbow Papers (supra) was in the context of a resolution process and not during Section 53, as held earlier, enacts the waterfall mechanism providing for the hierarchy or priority of claims of various of creditors.The careful design of Section 53 locates amounts payable to secured creditors and workmen at the second place, after the costs and of the liquidator payable during the proceedings.However, the dues payable to the government are placed much below those of secured creditors and even unsecured and operational creditors.This design was either not brought to the notice of the court in Rainbow Papers (supra) or was missed altogether.In any event, the judgment has not taken note of the provisions of the IBC which treat the dues payable to secured creditors at a higher footing than dues payable to Central or State Government.Taking recourse to the said observations made by the co-ordinate bench, the learned Counsels for the Review Petitioners have urged to review the impugned judgment.The said of the learned Counsels for the review petitioners to be outrightly for the simple reason that any passing of the impugned judgment made by the Bench of the equal strength could not be a ground for review.It is well settled of law that a co-ordinate Bench cannot comment upon the discretion or judgment by another co-ordinate Bench of the same strength.If a Bench does not accept as correct the decision on a question of law of another Bench of equal strength, the only proper course to adopt would be to refer the matter to the larger Bench, for decision, otherwise the law would be thrown into the state of uncertainty by reason of conflicting decisions.In JaiSri Sahu vs. Rajdewan Dubey and Others 8, a Bench of four Judges have made very pertinent observations in this regard - Law will be bereft of all its utility if it should be thrown into a state of uncertainty by reason of conflicting decisions, and it 8 AIR 1962 SC 83 is desirable that in case of of opinion, the question should be settled.In Mamleshwar Prasad and Another vs. Lal (Dead) Through L.Rs.9, it was observed that - Certainty of the law, consistency of rulings and comity of courts all flowering from the same principle converge to the conclusion that a decision once must later bind like cases.We do not intend to detract from the rule that, in exceptional instances, where by obvious or oversight a judgment fails to notice a plain provision or obligatory authority counter to the reasoning and result reached, it may not have the sway of binding It should be a glaring case, an obtrusive omission.A precise observations made by a three Judge Bench in Sant Lal Gupta and Others vs. Modern Cooperative Group Housing Society Limited and Others10, are worth noting A coordinate Bench cannot comment upon the discretion or judgment by another coordinate Bench of the same court.The rule of is binding for the reason that there is a desire to secure uniformity and certainty in law.Thus, in judicial which enunciate the rules of law form the foundation of the of justice under our system.it has always been insisted that the decision of a coordinate Bench must be followed.(Vide Tribhovandas Purshottamdas Thakkar vs. Ratilal Motilal Patel, Sub-Committee of Judicial Accountability vs. Union of India, and State of Tripura vs. Tripura Bar Association.)9 (1975) 2 SCC 232 10 (2010) 13 SCC 336 Apart from the legal position that a co-ordinate Bench cannot comment upon the judgment by another co-ordinate Bench of equal strength and that subsequent decision or a judgment of a co-ordinate Bench or larger Bench by itself cannot be regarded as a ground for review, the made by the learned Counsels for the Review Petitioners that the court in the impugned decision had failed to consider the waterfall mechanism as contained in Section 53 and failed to consider other provisions of IBC, are factually incorrect.As evident from the bare reading of the impugned judgment, the Court had considered not only the Waterfall mechanism under Section 53 of IBC but also the other provisions of the IBC for deciding the priority for the purpose of the proceeds from the sale as To be precise, the Court in the impugned judgment had categorically reproduced Section 53 in 20, other provisions of IBC along with the Regulations of 2016 in 21, and the subsequent amendments in the Regulations of 2018, with regard to the of claims to be made by the creditors in 22 23 of the judgment.The Court in the impugned judgment has also considered the earlier decisions of this Court in case of Mishra and Sons Private Limited through the authorized signatory vs. Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited through the Director and Others11 in 42.The decision in case of Ebix Singapore Private Limited vs. Committee of Creditors of Educomp Solutions Limited and Another 12 in 47, and observed as under - A resolution plan which does not meet the of SubSection (2) of Section 30 of the IBC, would be invalid and not binding on the Central Government, any State Government, any or other authority, any financial creditor, or other creditor to whom a debt in respect of dues arising under any law for the time being in force is owed.Such a resolution plan would not bind the State when there are outstanding dues of a Corporate Debtor.Section 31(1) of the IBC which empowers the Adjudicating Authority to approve a Resolution Plan uses the expression it shall by order approve the resolution plan which shall be binding subject to the condition that the Resolution Plan meets the of subsection (2) of Section 30.If a Resolution Plan meets the the Adjudicating Authority is mandatorily required to approve the Resolution Plan.On the other hand, Sub-section (2) of Section 31, which enables the Adjudicating Authority to reject a Resolution Plan which does not conform to the to in sub-section (1) of Section 31, uses the expression may.Ordinarily, the use of the word shall connotes a mandate binding direction, while use of the expression may connotes discretion.If says, a person may do a thing, he may also not do that thing.Even if Section 31(2) is construed to confer discretionary power on the Adjudicating Authority to reject a Resolution Plan, it has to be kept in mind that discretionary power cannot be whimsically or without proper application of mind to the facts 11 (2021) 9 SCC 657 12 2 SCC 401 and which require discretion to be one way or the other.After considering the Waterfall mechanism as contemplated in Section 53 and other provisions of IBC for the purpose of deciding as to whether Section 53 IBC would override Section 48 of the GVAT Act, it was finally concluded in the impugned order as under - In our considered view, the NCLAT clearly erred in its observation that Section 53 of the IBC over-rides Section 48 of the GVAT Act.Section 53 of the IBC begins with a non- obstante clause which reads - anything to the contrary contained in any law enacted by the Parliament or any State Legislature for the time being in force, the proceeds from the sale of the shall be distributed in the following order of priority.Section 48 of the GVAT Act is not contrary to or with Section 53 or any other provisions of the IBC.Under Section the debts owed to a secured creditor, which would include the State under the GVAT Act are to rank equally with other specified debts including debts on account of workmans dues for a period of 24 months preceding the date.As observed above, the State is a secured creditor under the GVAT Act.Section 3(30) of the IBC defines secured creditor to mean a creditor in favour of whom security interest is credited.Such security interest could be created by operation of law.The of secured creditor in the IBC does not exclude any Government or Governmental Authority.In view of the above stated position, we are of the opinion that the judgment sought to be does not fall within the scope and ambit of Review.The learned Counsels for the Review Petitioners have failed to make out any mistake or apparent on the face of record in the impugned judgment, and have failed to bring the case within the parameters laid down by this Court in various decision for reviewing the impugned judgment.Since we are not inclined to entertain these Review Petitions, we do not propose to deal with the other made by the learned Counsels for the parties on merits.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Union of India and Others, reported in (2013) 9 SCC 566 Prabhu Dayal Khandelwal v. Chairman, UPSC, reported in (2015) 14 SCC 427 7 to 9) and Rukhsana Shaheen Khan v.

ACR for the year which was communicated to the petitioner only on It is submitted that if the ACRs for the years 2016-17 and 2019-20 both having Good grading are excluded, in that case for rest of the years, the petitioner was having grading Very Good and the petitioner would have got the accordingly.3.2 Making above and relying upon the aforesaid decisions, it is prayed to direct the DPC High Court to ignore the uncommunicated ACR for the year 2016-17 and also the ACR for the year 2019-20, both having Good grading and to consider the case of the petitioner for taking into consideration the remaining ACRs, namely, ACRs for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19 in which the petitioner was having Very Good grading.While opposing the present appeal, Shri Maibam Singh, learned counsel appearing on

that the gradings in the ACRs for the years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 were communicated to the petitioner and others on one day before the impugned Departmental Committee proceedings.It is submitted that this did not deprive the petitioner and or any other candidate for submitting their if any, with regard to the said gradings within 15 days from the date of receipt of such communication.It is

Shri Jaideep Gupta, learned Sr. Advocate appearing on behalf of the promoted candidates relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of State of Himachal Pradesh vs. Raj Kumar, SCC OnLine SC 680 has submitted that as observed and held by this Court there is no rule of universal application that vacancies must necessarily be filled on the basis of rules which existed on the date when they arose.4.4 Making the above and relying upon above decisions, it is prayed to the present petition.We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length.In the present case the dispute is with respect to the post of Registrar in the High Court of Manipur.Prior to the Rules 2020, the to the post of Registrar was governed by the Gauhati High Court Service Rules, 1967.However, the Manipur High Court framed its own rules namely Rules, 2020.The DPC met to fill up the post of Registrar on as such the Rules, 2020 which were prevailing at the time when the DPC met were rightly considered.6.1 As per the Scheme of Examination for appointment to the posts of Registrar under Schedule of the Rules, 2020 under Serial No.12 which governs the for to Equivalent and above the Departmental proceedings were required to be conducted.As per the said Rule at Serial No.12, contained in Schedule of the Rules, 2020, the for to the post of Equivalent and above was to be made as under for to Equivalent and its above ACR Weightage 80 marks Viva Voce Interview 20 marks (to the and of the candidate to the said post) 6.2 As per Sl.No.13 of Schedule only when the merit of the candidates is the same, shall be given on the basis of seniority.6.3 It is not in dispute and cannot be disputed that for the post of to the Registrar the ACRs of preceding four years from the date of DPC were required to be taken into consideration.in the present case the ACRs for the period 2016- 2017 to were required to be taken into consideration and in fact taken into consideration.As observed out of 100 marks ACR weightage was of 80 marks.6.4 In the present case the petitioner got Good gradings for the year 2016-17 and Very Good gradings in her ACRs for the years 2017-18 and 2018-2019.It was the specific case on behalf of the petitioner which has not been denied that the ACRs grading of Good for the year 2016-17 was never communicated to the petitioner even till the DPC met.as per the law laid down by this Court in catena of decisions more particularly, as observed and held by this Court in Rukhsana Shaheen Khan (supra) Sukhdev Singh (supra) and Dev Dutt vs. Union of India and Ors, (2008) 8 SCC 725 uncommunicated adverse ACRs may be even with Good entry which can be said to be adverse in the context of for is not to be relied upon for consideration of uncommunicated ACR for the year 2016-17 having the grading Good could not have been relied upon for consideration for 6.5 Similarly so far as the ACR gradings for the year is concerned, admittedly the same was communicated to the petitioner on just one day before the DPC met on The petitioner was having 15 days time to make the against the ACR grading for the year Before the 15 days were over, the DPC met on and considered the case of the petitioner for The on behalf of the High Court that the other candidates who were also communicated the ACRs for the year 2019- 2020 on submitted their on and the petitioner also could have submitted the on like other candidates is concerned, it is neither here nor there.The fact remains that the petitioner was having 15 days time from to make a either the DPC could have been postponed or the ACR for the year ought not to have been considered and the same ought to have been treated as uncommunicated ACR.6.7 The sum and substance of the aforesaid would be that as the ACR Grading of Good for the year 2016-17 was not communicated till the DPC met, the same is to be ignored and or be not relied upon for consideration of Similarly, the grading for the year also is to be excluded and or be not relied upon for consideration for as the same was communicated on and the petitioner was granted 15 days time to make and before the could be made the DPC met on and considered the case of the petitioner for 6.8 At this stage the averments made in para 23 of the counter on behalf of the High Court to be noted.In 23, it is stated as under That, as a matter of fact, the interviews for the post of Registrar were conducted by two Honble Judges of the Manipur High Court on The gradings in the ACRs and information with regard to such gradings was not provided or made to the Honble Judges conducting the interviews.As such, the viva voce or the Petitioner and all other eligible candidates were not influenced and were of the gradings in the ACRs of the eligible candidates.Thus, according to the High Court, the grading in the ACRs and information with respect to such grading was not provided and or made to the Honble Judges conducting the interviews.The aforesaid is absolutely erroneous.As observed and held the ACR weightage was to be given of 80 marks and the ACRs gradings which carry a bigger portion of marks i.e., 80 marks out of 100 marks ought to have been taken into consideration by the High Court.In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the case of the petitioner for to the post of Registrar as on is required to be considered afresh ignoring the uncommunicated ACRs for the years 2016-17 and 2019-20 and her case is required to be considered afresh taking into consideration the ACRs for the years 2017-18 2018-19 for which the petitioner was having Very Good gradings.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supreme_Court_2022_887,"Rastogi, J.Signature Not Verified 1.Leave granted.Digitally signed by BABITA PANDEY Date 181850 IST Reason The instant appeals are directed against the decision of the High Court of Manipur dated 28th October, 2021 and 16th 2021 setting aside the order of detention passed under Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988 to as the Act 1988) on the premise that the appellants failed to supply the legible copies of documents which were relied upon by the appellants while passing the order of detention under the provisions of the Act 1988.Respondent no.1, in both the appeals, was pursuant to the order impugned dated 28th October, 2021 passed by the High Court and the period of detention of one year also expired.Notice was issued by this Court on 18th April, but no one appeared on behalf of respondent no.1 despite service of notice.On the last date of hearing, i.e., 1st this Court Ms. Prerna Singh, learned Advocate to appear as Amicus Curiae on behalf of respondent no.1 in both the appeals which she voluntarily accepted and the Court.We have heard learned counsel for the appellants, Ms. Prerna Singh, Amicus Curiae on behalf of the respondent no.1 in both the appeals as well as learned counsel for respondent no.2 and with their perused the material on record.The challenge in the writ petition originally filed on behalf of respondent no.1 was the order of detention dated 17 th May, 2021 and the grounds of detention dated 22 nd May, 2021 passed by the Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, whereby respondent no.1 was subjected to detention under the provisions of the Act 1988.The main thrust on which the writ petition was filed under Article 226 of the assailing the order of detention was that respondent no.1 was not supplied with legible copies of the documents relied upon by the detaining authority while passing the order of detention and that has taken away the valuable right of respondent no.1 in making an The right to make a is a fundamental right and nonsupply of the legible copies of the documents relied upon by the authorities in passing the order of detention is in violation of Article 22(5) of the and placed reliance on the judgments of this Court in Smt.Dharmista Bhagat v. State of Another 1, Manjit Singh Grewal Gogi v. Union of India Ors.2, Mehrunissa v. State of and Bhupinder Singh v. Union of India Others4.The Bench of the High Court placed reliance on the aforesaid judgments of this Court and set aside the order of detention dated 17th May, 2021 passed by the Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur.Respondent no.1 in his writ petition, para 9 and ground (e) in particular, has stated that the documents which formed 1 1989 Supp (2) SCC 155 2 1990 (Supp.)SCC 59 3 (1981) 2 SCC 709 4 (1987) 2 SCC 234 the basis of the grounds of detention at pages 31, 33, 35, 37, 38 are and all blurred and not readable and as such respondent no.1 could not make an before the detaining authority and enclosed the grounds of detention dated 22nd May, 2021 along with the petition.Para 9 of the writ petition and ground (e) are extracted That, it is pertinent to mention herein that the documents which form the basis of the grounds of detention at page no.31, 33, 35, 37, 38 enclosed herewith are all blurred and not readable and as such the detenu could not make an before the detaining authority, the impugned order and subsequent orders are liable to be set aside.The blurred and unreadable original documents furnished to the detenu while he was under detention have been filed along with the writ petition.A true copy of the documents which are not readable enclosed in the grounds of detention dated is enclosed herewith and marked as AnnexureA/3.For, that the documents which form the basis of the grounds of detention and enclosed herewith are not readable and could not make an and as such the detention order is liable to be set aside.In the counter affidavit filed by the appellants before the High Court, the only was that all the relevant documents relied upon by the detaining authority were supplied to respondent no.1 and he did not make any such request in his of the documents relied upon by the detaining authority either being blurred or at any stage during pendency of the proceedings until the final order of detention came to be passed by the detaining authority.The extract of relevant para no.10 of counter affidavit is reproduced That, with to Para Nos.9 and 15(e) of the Writ Petition, the deponent begs to submit that all legible documents which form the basis of the grounds of detention were furnished to the detenu.Moreover, the detenu while submitting his could have sought any relevant document from the Detaining Authority as done in other cases.However, the petitioner did not mention any such request in his submitted to the detaining authority.Original receipt annexed hereto and marked as A.Likewise, in Writ Petition (Crl.)No.15 of 2021 before the High Court, similar averments were made.Extracts of para 9 and ground (e) are reproduced That, it is pertinent to mention herein that the documents which form the basis of the grounds of detention at page nos.79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 93, 95 enclosed herewith are all blurred and not readable and even then the respondent No.1 furnished incomplete documents while furnishing the documents of ground of detention to the petitioner (left behind most of the pages of documents annexed in ground of detention).The petitioner has filed the documents in original before the Honble Court, furnished by the respondent no.1 and as such the detenu could not make an before the detaining authority, the impugned order are liable to be set aside.A true copy of the documents which are not readable enclosed in the grounds of detention dated is enclosed herewith and marked as AnnexureA/3.For, that the documents which form the basis of the grounds of detention and enclosed herewith are not readable and could not make an and as such the detention order is liable to be set aside.In the counter affidavit filed by the appellants to the aforesaid writ petition before the High Court, in para 9, the appellants replied as under That with to Para No.9 of the criminal petition, it is submitted that while serving grounds of detention all relevant documents were enclosed.Moreover, the detenu while submitting her done in other cases.However, the petitioner did not mention any such request in her submitted to the detaining authority.Annexure R/4 is the true copy of the Ground of detention.Learned counsel for the appellants has not disputed the settled by this Court that supply of legible copies of the documents relied upon by the detaining authority is a sine qua non for making an which is the fundamental right of detenu guaranteed under Article 22(5) of the The only made by learned counsel for the appellants is that respondent no.1, at no stage, raised any objection that the pages of the documents relied upon by the detaining authority in the grounds of detention were or blurred which, in any manner, has denied him the opportunity of making and the objection was raised, for the first time, before the High Court and not at any stage before the detaining authority.In the given facts and learned counsel submits that the made by the High Court in setting aside the order of detention is not sustainable and to be with by this Court.Learned Amicus Curiae appearing on behalf of respondent no.1 supported the order of the High Court and submitted that once it is settled that the supply of legible copies of documents relied upon by the detaining authority is a sine qua non for making an to be a part of his fundamental right under Article 22(5) of the and once this specific allegation was made by respondent no.1 in the writ petition with facts and particulars and also the pages which, according to him, were and blurred and that has deprived respondent no.1 in making an denial thereof was indeed in violation of Article 22(5) of the and once the fundamental right has been infringed, even if it was not raised before the detaining authority, that will not take away the fundamental right conferred by law to respondent no.1 in assailing order of detention as permissible to him under the law and once this fact remains uncontroverted, no has been committed by the High Court in setting aside the order of detention.Article 22(5) of the confers two rights on the detenu, firstly, the right to be informed of the grounds on which the order of detention has been made and, secondly, to be afforded an earliest opportunity to make a against the order of detention.It is well settled that right to make a implies that the detenu should have all the information that will enable him to make an No doubt, this right is again subject to the right or privilege given by clause (6).At the same time, refusal to supply the documents by the detenu or supply of or blurred copies of the documents relied upon by the detaining authority amounts to violation of Article 22(5) of the Although it is true that whether an opportunity has been afforded to make an always depends on the facts and of each case.What will be the effect when the detune is deprived of or denial of supply of relied upon documents by the detaining authority has been considered by this Court in A. Kamat v. Union of India and Others5 as under The right to make a is a fundamental right.The thus made should be considered expeditiously by the government.In order to make an the detenu is entitled to obtain information relating to the grounds of detention.When the grounds of detention are served on the detenu, he is entitled to ask for copies of the and documents to in the grounds of detention to enable him to make an When the detenu makes a request 5 (1980) 2 SCC 270 for such documents, they should be supplied to him expeditiously.The detaining authority in preparing the grounds would have to the and documents relied on in the grounds of detention and would be ordinarily with him when copies of such documents are asked for by the detenu the detaining authority should be in a position to supply them with reasonable expedition.What is reasonable expedition will depend on the facts of each case.What will be the effect of nonsupply of legible copies of the documents relied upon by the detaining authority has been considered by this Court in Bhupinder Singh (supra) as under On 3101985 the officers of the Enforcement Directorate searched House No.B.20, Town, Part II, Delhi and certain quantity of foreign exchange.It appears that the petitioner was not immediately He was called and interrogated.He made a which was recorded by the officers of the Enforcement Directorate.On 1931986 an order for detention of the petitioner was made by Shri M.L.Additional Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of New Delhi.The petitioner was arrested on 164 1986 and served with a copy of the order of detention.Grounds of detention were served on him four days later.On 1251986 he was produced before the Advisory Board.He made a complaint before the Advisory Board that the copies of documents which were supplied to him along with the grounds of detention were not legible and he also placed before the Advisory Board a copy of a said to have been made by him for supply of legible copies of documents.There is a controversy whether this was made on 851986 or 1251986.From the original files produced before us we find that the was typed on 851986, but actually signed by the detenu on 1251986.But that would not make any for the purposes of this case.On 1951986 the to the Government of India conceded the demand of the detenu for legible copies of documents and directed the Directorate of Enforcement to supply a duplicate set of documents to the petitioner.A copy of this letter was also sent to the detenu and was acknowledged by him on 21 51986.There is a controversy as regards the date on which the legible copies of documents were actually given to the detenu.According to the detenu they were served on him on 171986, whereas according to the counteraffidavit of Shri K. Chowdhry, in the Ministry of Finance, the documents were supplied on 2161986.It does not make any whether the documents were supplied on 2161986 or on 171986 since we find that even before legible copies of documents were supplied to the detenu, the detention order was confirmed on 1461986.The detenu was thus clearly denied the opportunity of making a and there was a clear of the right guaranteed by Article 22 of the The detenu is entitled to be set at liberty.We are told that the detenu is now on parole.He need not and later in Manjit Singh Grewal (supra) as under It appears that the appellant had asked for certain copies of the documents which admittedly were there with the respondent Union of India.Copies of the documents were supplied, but the same were not legible.This position is also apparent.It is not necessary in the facts of this case to go into the question whether these documents were relevant or material.Learned counsel also relied upon the judgment of this Court in Union of India v. Ranu Bhandari6 wherein it was held in paras 27 and 31 as under It has also been the consistent view that when a detention order is passed all the material relied upon by the detaining authority in making such an order, must be 6 (2008) 17 SCC 348 supplied to the detenu to enable him to make an against the detention order in compliance with Article 22(5) of the of whether he had knowledge of the same or not.These have been recognised by this Court as the safeguards to ensure that detention laws, which are an evil necessity, do not become instruments of oppression in the hands of the authorities concerned or to avoid criminal proceedings which would entail a proper 2830.Of course, in case 9 SCC 170 it was also made clear that there is no legal that a copy of every document mentioned in the order has to be supplied to the detenu.What is, imperative is that copies of such documents which had been relied upon by the detaining authority for reaching the satisfaction that in the interest of the State and its citizens the detention of the detenu is necessary, have to be supplied to him.if in this case, the detenus and writ petition had been placed before the detaining authority, which according to the detenu contained his entire to the allegations made against him, the same may have weighed with the detaining authority as to the necessity of issuing the order of detention at all.Thus, the legal position has been settled by this Court that the right to make is a fundamental right of the detenu under Article 22(5) of the and supply of the copy of documents which has been relied upon by the detaining authority indeed has deprived him in making an and denial thereof will hold the order of detention and not in with the procedure contemplated under law.It is the admitted case of the parties that respondent no.1 has failed to question before the detaining authority that or blurred copies were supplied to him which were relied upon while passing the order of detention, but the right to make being a fundamental right under Article 22(5) of the in order to make the detenu is always entitled to be supplied with the legible copies of the documents relied upon by the detaining authority and such information made in the grounds of detention enables him to make an Proceeding on the principles which have now been settled by this Court, it was specifically raised by the respondents in their writ petition and the has been made in para 9 of the petition to(supra) and in the pleadings on record, there was no denial in the counter filed by the appellants before the High Court that the documents which were supplied and relied upon by the detaining authority were legible and that has not denied respondent no.1 in making while questioning the order of detention and once this fact remain uncontroverted from the records as being placed before the High Court in writ petition filed under Article 226 of the and the legal principles being settled, we find no substance in the made by learned counsel for the appellants that merely because respondent no.1 has failed to raise this question before the detaining authority which go into root of the matter to take away the right vested in the appellant detenu in assailing the order of detention while availing the remedy to him under Article 226 of the of India.In other words, the right of personal liberty and freedom which is probably the most cherished is not, in any manner, to be taken away from him even temporarily without following the procedure prescribed by law and once the detenu was able to satisfy while assailing the order of detention before the High Court in of Article 226 of the holding that the grounds of detention did not satisfy the rigors of proof as a foundational effect which has enabled him in making in assailing the order of detention in view of the protection provided under Article 22(5) of the the same renders the order of detention and we find no being committed by the High Court in setting aside the order of detention under the impugned judgment.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Supreme_Court_2022_726,"B. J.Leave granted.This appeal is at the instance of a defendant in a suit filed by the respondents herein (original plaintiffs) for the specific performance of contract based on an dated 08.06.1979 Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by Dr. Mukesh Nasa and is directed against the judgment and order passed by the High Date IST Reason Court of Judicature at Bombay dated in the Appeal L No.499 of 2018, arising from the order passed by a learned Single Judge on its ordinary original civil side in the Chamber Summons No.854 of 2017 in the Suit No.894 of 1986 dated The Chamber Summons was allowed by the High Court at the instance of the plaintiffs, permitting the plaintiffs to amend the plaint.The order passed by the High Court in the Chamber Summons came to be affirmed by a Bench in the Appeal L No.499 of 2018.The High Court permitted the plaintiffs to amend the plaint, seeking to enhance the amount towards the alternative claim for damages.FACTUAL MATRIX It appears from the materials on record that the respondents herein are the original plaintiffs and the appellant herein is the original defendant in the Suit No.894 of 1986, pending as on date in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay on its original side.The said suit has been seeking specific performance of the dated In the alternative, the plaintiffs have also prayed for damages.The plaintiffs moved the Chamber Summons No.854 of 2017, inter alia, seeking of the amount towards damages on the grounds, more particularly, set out in the affidavit filed in support of the said chamber summons.The learned Single Judge of the High Court allowed the chamber summons to above, vide the order dated keeping the issue of open and also permitting the defendant, appellant herein, to file additional written The appellant herein an appeal against the said order which came to be vide the impugned order dated Being aggrieved and with the impugned order passed by the High Court to above, the appellant (original defendant) is here before this Court with the present appeal.ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant, submitted that the High Court committed a serious in passing the impugned order.He would submit that the High Court the order passed by this Court in the Life Insurance of India v. Sanjeev Builders Pvt.Ltd.Ors., (2018) 11 SCC 722 the same parties, arising from the same suit proceedings.The learned counsel would submit that the High Court should not have permitted the plaintiffs to amend the plaint after a period of thirty-one years, more particularly, when the earlier amendment seeking to implead the assignee as the plaintiff No.3 in the suit was declined by this Court vide the judgment and order dated 24.10.2017 passed in the Life Insurance of India (supra).The learned counsel would submit that the High Court failed to consider that the amendment was hit by the provisions of Order II Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (for short, the CPC).He would submit that the amendment could be said to be even hit by the principle of constructive res judicata.The learned counsel pointed out that at the time when the suit came to be the damages to the tune of Rs.Rs.One Crore One Lakh only in the alternative was prayed for.By way of amendment the damages now prayed for is to the tune of Rs.Rs.Four Hundred Crore One Lakh only.In such to above, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant (original defendant) prayed that there being merit in his appeal, the same may be allowed and the impugned order passed by the High Court may be set aside and the original amendment application filed by the plaintiffs be ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS The learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents herein (original plaintiffs) on the other hand, submitted that no not to speak of any of law, could be said to have been committed by the High Court in passing the impugned order.It is submitted that the question of has been kept open by the High Court that may be agitated by the defendant in the trial and the defendant has also been permitted to file its additional written The learned counsel would submit that the suit is yet to be and in such the delay in amending the plaint for the purpose of the amount towards damages would not cause any serious prejudice to the defendant.The learned counsel further submitted that the provisions of Order II Rule 2 of the CPC cannot be made applicable to an application seeking amendment of plaint.The learned counsel in the last submitted that the decision of this Court in the case of Life Insurance of India (supra) the same parties was altogether in a different context.In the said appeal before this Court, the issue was whether the assignee could have been impleaded as one of the plaintiffs in the suit after a period of years from the date of of the suit?In such to above, the learned counsel appearing for the plaintiffs prays that there being no merit in this appeal, the same may be with costs.ANALYSIS Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the following questions of law fall for the consideration of this Court Whether the High Court committed any material or going to the root of the matter in passing the impugned order?Whether the provisions of Order II Rule 2 CPC can be made applicable to an amendment application?Whether the amendment of plaint for the purpose of the amount towards damages could be said to be hit by the doctrine of constructive res judicata?Whether the judgment and order passed by a coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Life Insurance of India (supra) the same parties has any bearing on the present appeal?Whether the present appeal is covered by the proviso to Section 21(5) and Section resply of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (47 of 1963) (for short, the Act 1963)?Before adverting to the rival canvassed on either side and before we deal with the orders passed by the High Court permitting the plaintiffs to amend the plaint with respect to the prayer clause, let us consider, the laws on the question of allowing or rejecting a prayer for amendment of the pleadings, more particularly, when the plea of was taken by one of the parties.It is well settled that the court must be liberal in granting the prayer for amendment, if the court is of the view that if such amendment is not allowed, a party, who has prayed for such an amendment, shall suffer loss and injury.It is also equally well settled that there is no absolute rule that in every case where a relief is barred because of amendment should not be allowed.It is always open to the court to allow an amendment if it is of the view that allowing of an amendment shall really sub-serve the ultimate cause of justice and avoid further In L.J.Leach Co. Ltd. Anr.v. Jardine Skinner Co., AIR 1957 SC 357, this Court at 16 of the said decision observed as follows It is no doubt true that courts would, as a rule, decline to allow amendments, if a fresh suit on the amended claim would be barred by on the date of the application.But that is a factor to be taken into account in of the discretion as to whether amendment should be ordered, and does not affect the power of the court to order it, if that is required in the interest of justice Again in T.N.Alloy Foundry Co. Ltd. v. T.N.Electricity Board Ors., (2004) 3 SCC 392, this Court observed as follows The law as regards permitting amendment to the plaint, is well settled.In L.J.Leach and Co. Ltd. v. Jardine Skinner and Co. AIR 1957 SC 357 1957 SCR 438 it was held that the Court would as a rule decline to allow amendments, if a fresh suit on the amended claim would be barred by on the date of the application.But that is a factor to be taken into account in of the discretion as to whether amendment should be ordered, and does not affect the power of the court to order it.It is not disputed that the appellate court has a power of the trial court.We find that the discretion by the High Court in rejecting the plaint was in conformity with law.So far as the answer to the specific plea that the claim of damages is barred by and cannot be permitted at this stage is concerned, it becomes necessary to examine the various judicial of this Court.The principles governing an amendment which may be permitted even after the expiry of the period of were laid down by the Privy Council in its judgment in Charan Das Ors.v. Amir Khan Ors., AIR 1921 PC 50.In this case, the Privy Council laid down the principles thus That there was full power to make the amendment cannot be disputed, and though such a power should not as a rule be where its effect is to take away from a defendant a legal right which has accrued to him by lapse of time, yet there are cases see for example Mohummud Zahoor Ali v. Rutta Koer, where such considerations are outweighed by the special of the case, and their Lordships are not prepared to differ from the Judicial Commissioner in thinking that the present case is one.It would be useful to also notice the observations of this Court in, Pirgonda Hongonda Patil v. Kalgonda Shidgonda Patil 2 Ors., 1957 SCR 595 AIR 1957 SC 363, wherein this Court considered an objection to the amendment on the ground that the same amounted to a new case and a new cause of action.In this case, this Court laid down the principles which would govern the of discretion as to whether the court ought to permit an amendment of the pleadings or not.This Court approved the observations of Batchelor, J., in the case of Kisandas Rupchand Anr.v. Vithoba Shilwant and Ors.reported in ILR (1909) 33 Bom 644, when he laid down the principles thus All amendments ought to be allowed which satisfy the two conditions (a) of not working injustice to the other side, and (b) of being necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy the parties but I refrain from citing further authorities, as, in my opinion, they all lay down precisely the same doctrine.That doctrine, as I understand it, is that amendments should be refused only where the other party cannot be placed in the same position as if the pleading had been originally correct, but the amendment would cause him an injury which could not be compensated in costs.It is merely a particular case of this general rule that where a plaintiff seeks to amend by setting up a fresh claim in respect of a cause of action which since the of the suit had become barred by the amendment must be refused to allow it would be to cause the defendant an injury which could not be compensated in costs by depriving him of a good to the claim.The ultimate test still remains the same can the amendment be allowed without injustice to the other side, or can it not?This Court has held that the power to allow an amendment is undoubtedly wide and may be at any stage in the interests of justice, the law of In this behalf, in Ganga Bai v. Vijay Kumar Ors., (1974) 2 SCC 393, this Court held thus The power to allow an amendment is undoubtedly wide and may at any stage be in the interest of justice, the law of But the of such far-reaching discretionary powers is governed by judicial considerations and wider the discretion, greater ought to be the care and on the part of the Court Again in M s Ganesh Trading Co. v. Moji Ram, (1978) 2 SCC 91, this Court laid down the principles thus It is clear from the foregoing summary of the main rules of pleadings that provisions for the amendment of pleadings, subject to such terms as to costs and giving of all parties concerned necessary opportunities to meet exact situations resulting from amendments, are intended for promoting the ends of justice and not for defeating them.Even if a party or its Counsel is in setting out its case the shortcoming can certainly be removed generally by steps taken by a party which must no doubt pay costs for the or caused to the other side from its The is not incapable of being rectified so long as remedial steps do not unjustifiably injure rights accrued.The principles applicable to the amendments of the plaint are equally applicable to the amendments of the written The courts are more generous in allowing the amendment of the written as question of prejudice is less likely to operate in that event.The defendant has a right to take alternative plea in which, however, is subject to an exception that by the proposed amendment other side should not be subjected to injustice and that any admission made in favor of the plaintiff is not withdrawn.All amendments of the pleadings should be allowed which are necessary for determination of the real controversies in the suit provided the proposed amendment does not alter or a new cause of action on the basis of which the original lis was raised or taken.and contradictory allegations in negation to the admitted position of facts or mutually destructive allegations of facts should not be allowed to be incorporated by means of amendment to the pleadings.The proposed amendment should not cause such prejudice to the other side which cannot be compensated by costs.No amendment should be allowed which amounts to or relates in defeating a legal right accruing to the opposite party on account of lapse of time.The delay in filing the application for amendment of the pleadings should be properly compensated by costs and or mistake which, if not fraudulent, should not be made a ground for rejecting the application for amendment of plaint or written (See South Konkan Anr.v. Naik Ors., (2008) 14 SCC 632) But undoubtedly, every case and every application for amendment has to be tested in the applicable facts and of the case.As the proposed amendment of the pleadings amounts to only a different or an additional approach to the same facts, this Court has laid down the principle that such an amendment would be allowed even after the expiry of period of In this behalf, in A.K.Gupta Sons Ltd. v. Damodar Valley AIR 1967 SC 96 (1966) 1 SCR 796, this Court held thus 7. a new case or a new cause of action particularly when a suit on the new case or cause of action is barred Weldon v. Neale 19 QBD 394.But it is also well recognised that where the amendment does not the addition of a new cause of action or raise a different case, but amounts to no more than a different or additional approach to the same facts, the amendment will be allowed even after the expiry of the period of In entitled, G. Anr.v.Anr., (1996) 2 SCC 25, this Court considered the proposed amendment of the plaint and noticing that neither the cause of action would change nor the relief would be materially affected, allowed the same.This Court in this case noticed that in the plaintiffs suit for specific performance, the plaintiff was entitled to plead even pleas and that in the present case, the plaintiffs were seeking only the alternative reliefs.It appears that the plaintiffs had filed a suit for specific performance of an of By the application under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC for amendment of the plaint, the appellants were pleading that the transactions of execution of the sale deed and obtaining a document for re- conveyance were single transactions viz.mortgage by conditional sale.They also wanted to incorporate an alternative relief to the mortgage.At the end of the prayer, the plaintiff sought alternatively to grant of a for redemption of the mortgage.This amendment was permitted by this Court.In Anr.v. Yellappa (dead) by lrs.Ors., (2004) 6 SCC 415, this Court held that it was in the discretion of the court to allow an application under Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC seeking amendment of the plaint even where the relief sought to be by amendment was barred by The Court noticed that there was no absolute rule that the amendment in such a case should not be allowed.It was pointed out that the courts discretion in this regard depends on the facts and of the case and has to be on a judicial evaluation thereof.It would be apposite to notice the observations of this Court in this in extenso.The principles were laid down by this Court thus So far as the courts to allow an amendment of pleadings is concerned, there can be no two opinions that the same is wide enough to permit amendments even in cases where there has been substantial delay in filing such amendment applications.This Court in numerous cases has held that the dominant purpose of allowing the amendment is to the if the facts of the case so permit, it is always open to the court to allow applications in spite of the delay and laches in moving such amendment application.But the question for our consideration is whether in cases where the delay has extinguished the right of the party by virtue of expiry of the period of prescribed in law, can the court in the of its discretion take away the right accrued to another party by allowing such belated amendments.The law in this regard is also quite clear and consistent that there is no absolute rule that in every case where a relief is barred because of an amendment should not be allowed.Discretion in such cases depends on the facts and of the case.The to allow or not allow an amendment being discretionary, the same will have to be on a judicious evaluation of the facts and in which the amendment is sought.If the granting of an amendment really the ultimate cause of justice and avoids further the same should be allowed.There can be no formula for allowing or disallowing an amendment of pleadings.Each case depends on the factual background of that case.This view of this Court has, since, been followed by a Bench of this Court in the case of T.N.Alloy Foundry Co. Ltd. v. T.N.Electricity Board (2004) 3 SCC an application for amendment of the pleading should not be disallowed merely because it is opposed on the ground that the same is barred by on the contrary, application will have to be considered bearing in mind the discretion that is vested with the court in allowing or disallowing such amendment in the interest of justice.We think that the course adopted by this Court in Ragu Thilak D. John case (2001) 2 SCC 472 applies to the facts of this case.The courts below have on an assumption that the amendment sought for by the appellants is ipso facto barred by the law of and amounts to introduction of different relief than what the plaintiff had asked for in the original plaint.We do not agree with the courts below that the amendment sought for by the plaintiff introduces a different relief so as to bar the grant of prayer for amendment, necessary factual basis has already been laid down in the plaint in regard to the title which, of course, was denied by the respondent in his written which will be an issue to be in a trial.in the facts of this case, it will be incorrect to come to the conclusion that by the amendment the plaintiff will be introducing a different relief.From the above, one of the cardinal principles of law in allowing or rejecting an application for amendment of the pleading is that the courts generally, as a rule, decline to allow amendments, if a fresh suit on the amended claim would be barred by on the date of filing of the application.But that would be a factor to be taken into account in the of the discretion as to whether the amendment should be ordered, and does not affect the power of the court to order it, if that is required in the interest of justice.In Ragu Thilak D. John v. S.Ors., (2001) 2 SCC 472, this Court also observed that where the amendment was barred by time or not, was a disputed question of fact and, that prayer for amendment could not be and in that the issue of can be made an issue in the suit itself like the one made by the High Court in the case on hand.In a decision in Vishwambhar Ors.v. (Dead) through Lrs.Anr., (2001) 6 SCC 163, this Court held that the amendment though properly made cannot relate back to the date of filing of the suit, but to the date of filing of the application.Again, in Vineet Kumar v. Mangal Sain Wadhera, (1984) 3 SCC 352 AIR 1985 SC 817, this Court held that if a prayer for amendment merely adds to the facts already on record, the amendment would be allowed even after the period of IMPUGNED ORDERS We now proceed to look into the two orders passed by the High Court i.e.one by the learned Single Judge and the other in the appeal by the Bench.The learned Single Judge in Sanjeev Builders Pvt.Ltd. Ors.Life Insurance of India, 2018 SCC OnLine Bom 15283, while allowing the Chamber Summons and permitting the plaintiffs to amend the plaint, observed thus It is the case of the applicant as submitted by Ms. Panda that while filing the suit, plaintiffs quantified the estimated damages likely to be caused to them by reason of non performance at Rs.The value of the suit property increased during the pendency of the suit.According to plaintiffs estimate, the value of the property today can be estimated to be Rs.and if the court is not inclined to grant specific performance, then the damages which plaintiffs would suffer on account of non performance by the defendants under the should be Rs.there is already claim for damages but what plaintiffs are seeking today is only the claim, of course subject to provisions of Section 73 of the Contract Act.Ms. submitted that after 30 years, this application is filed for and ex- facie the increased amount is barred by Ms. submitted that though the settled position in law is that courts are generally liberal with pre-trial amendment, when ex-facie claim appears to be barred by the court should not permit the amendment.What one should keep in mind is this figure of Rs.can go up or go down.Plaintiffs are only estimating it to be the amount which according to plaintiffs, is the loss which they would suffer.Whether that is the right estimate can be only at the time of trial.Even in para 12 of the plaint plaintiff has stated .suffered loss and damages which they estimate at.In prayer clause-(b)(v) plaintiff pray or such other sum as this Honourable Court may deem just and proper Further, if this figure of Rs.is not amended as prayed in this Notice of Motion, defendant will object the of plaintiff to claim more as damages saying plaintiff cannot go beyond what is averred in the plaint.Due to situation beyond the control of plaintiff, this suit has remained pending for almost 32 years.Chances of suffering greater prejudice is more if the amendment is not allowed.It is clarified that plaintiff will still have to prove every penny it is claiming as damages.Admittedly, the trial is yet to begun though have been framed long ago.In the keeping open rights and of defendants to raise the issue of which the court will decide at the time of trial, Chamber summons allowed in terms of prayer clause-(a) and accordingly disposed.While affirming the aforesaid order, the High Court in Appeal (L) No.499 of 2018 held as under Undisputedly, trial is yet to commence.The amendment has been allowed by the learned Single Judge by giving cogent and sound reasons.Merely because the Plaintiffs are permitted to amend the plaint does not mean that the claim which has been made by the Plaintiffs by way of amendment would be granted by the Court.Defendants can always file an additional Written to contest the claim of the Plaintiffs.In such additional Written Appellants can also raise a ground with regard to which will have to be gone into by the learned Single Judge.In any case, in the present case, Appellants have also filed additional Written so as to meet the grounds brought on record by way of amendment.In that view of the matter, we do not find that this is a fit case to with the discretion by the learned Single Judge.Appeal is LIFE INSURANCE OF INDIA (SUPRA) We now proceed to give a fair idea, as regards the judgment by a coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Life Insurance of India (supra) dated The said appeal before this Court arose out of the judgment of the High Court of Bombay dated in and by which the Bench the appeal filed by the appellant herein Life Insurance of India (for short, LIC) thereby affirming the order of the Single Judge in the Chamber Summons No.187 of 2014 by which the respondent No.3 therein was impleaded as the plaintiff No.3 in the Suit No.894 of 1986.It appears from the pleadings, more particularly, the facts recorded in the judgment by the coordinate Bench that in the year 2014, the respondent No.3 therein, namely, the Kedia Construction Company Ltd. filed the Chamber Summons No.187 of 2014 stating that subsequent to the filing of the suit for the specific performance of contract, with the consent of the respondent No.2, plaintiff No.1/respondent No.1 had assigned its interest to the respondent No.3 for a consideration of Rs.by an for sale dated The chamber summons was filed to implead the respondent No.3 therein as the plaintiff No.3 with a prayer to amend the plaint pursuant to the of sale in its favour.The appellant herein (LIC) had opposed the chamber summons on the ground that the respondent No.3 therein was not a bona fide assignee or a necessary party and that the in the suit were framed on and there had been an inordinate delay on 27 years in filing the application which had not been properly explained.In the aforesaid set of facts, this Court while allowing the appeal filed by the appellant herein (LIC) held as under The stand of Respondent 3 is that it claims as an assignee of the rights of Respondents 1 and 2 and that it has the right to continue the suit under Order 22 Rule 10 CPC and the provisions of do not apply to such an application.To appreciate merits of this we may usefully refer to Order 22 Rule 10 CPC, which reads as under Order 22 Death, Marriage and Insolvency of Parties Procedure in case of assignment before final order in suit.(1) In other cases of an assignment, creation or devolution of any interest during the pendency of a suit, the suit may, by leave of the court, be continued by or against the person to or upon whom such interest has come or devolved.The of a pending an appeal therefrom shall be to be an interest entitling the person who procured such to the benefit of sub-rule (1).Under Order 22 Rule 10 CPC, when there has been an assignment or devolution of interest during the pendency of a suit, the suit may, by leave of the court, be continued by or against person to or upon whom such interest has been assigned or devolved and this entitles the person who has acquired an interest in the of the by an assignment or creation or devolution of interest lite or suitor or any other person to apply to the court for leave to continue the suit.When the plaintiff transfers the suit during the pendency of the suit, the assignee is entitled to be brought on record and continue the suit.Order 22 Rule 10 CPC enables only of the suit by the leave of the court.It is the duty of the court to decide whether leave was to be granted or not to the person or to the assignee to continue the suit.The discretion to implead or not to implead parties who apply to continue the suit must be judiciously and not The High Court was not right in holding that mere alleged transfer assignment of the would be sufficient to grant leave to Respondent 3 to continue the suit.From the filing of the suit in 1986, over the years, valuable right of accrued to the appellant such valuable right of cannot be by granting leave to the third respondent to continue the suit in the application filed under Order 22 Rule 10 CPC after 27 years of filing of the suit.The learned Single Judge was not right in saying that impleading Respondent 3 as Plaintiff 3 would cause no prejudice to the appellant and that the can be raised at the time of trial.In a suit for specific performance, application for impleadment must be filed within a reasonable time.Considering the question of impleadment of party in a suit for specific performance after to various judgments, in Vidur Impex and Traders (P) Ltd. v. Tosh Apartments (P) Ltd. Vidur Impex and Traders (P) Ltd. v. Tosh Apartments (P) Ltd., (2012) 8 SCC 384 (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 1 the Court summarised the principles as under (SCC p. 413, para 41) Though there is apparent conflict in the observations made in some of the judgments, the broad principles which should govern disposal of an application for impleadment are 41.1.The court can, at any stage of the proceedings, either on an application made by the parties or otherwise, direct impleadment of any person as party, who ought to have been joined as plaintiff or defendant or whose before the court is necessary for and complete adjudication of the involved in the suit.41.2.A necessary party is the person who ought to be joined as party to the suit and in whose absence an cannot be passed by the court.41.3.A proper party is a person whose would enable the court to completely, and properly adjudicate upon all matters and though he may not be a person in favour of or against whom a is to be made.41.4.If a person is not found to be a proper or necessary party, the court does not have the to order his impleadment against the wishes of the plaintiff.41.5.In a suit for specific performance, the court can order impleadment of a purchaser whose conduct is above board, and who files application for being joined as party within reasonable time of his acquiring knowledge about the pending 41.6.However, if the applicant is guilty of contumacious conduct or is beneficiary of a clandestine transaction or a transaction made by the owner of the suit property in violation of the restraint order passed by the court or the application is unduly delayed then the court will be fully justified in declining the prayer for impleadment.In light of the above principles, considering the case in hand, in our view, the application filed for impleading Respondent 3 as Plaintiff 3 was not filed within reasonable time.No explanation is offered for such an inordinate delay of 27 years, which was not kept in view by the High Court.Be it noted that an application under Order 22 Rule 10 CPC seeking leave of the court to continue the suit by the assignee third respondent was not actually filed.Chamber Summons No.187 of 2014 was filed praying to amend the suit which would have been the consequential amendment, had the leave to continue the suit been granted by the court.As pointed out earlier, the application was filed after 27 years of filing of the suit.Of course, the power to allow the amendment of suit is wide and the court should not adopt hypertechnical approach.In considering amendment applications, court should adopt liberal approach and amendments are to be allowed to avoid of We are conscious that mere delay is not a ground for rejecting the amendment.But in the case in hand, the parties are not rustic litigants all the respondents are companies and the dispute the parties is a commercial In such facts and the amendment prayed in the chamber summons filed under Order 22 Rule 10 CPC ought not to have been allowed, as the same would cause serious prejudice to the appellant.In our view, the impugned order, allowing Chamber Summons No.187 of 2014 filed after 27 years of the suit would take away the substantial rights of accrued to the appellant and the same cannot be sustained.In the result, the impugned judgment LIC v. Sanjeev Builders (P) Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Bom 4811 is set aside and the appeal is allowed.Chamber Summons No.187 of 2014 in Suit No.894 of 1986 stands No order as to costs.Thus, from the aforesaid, it is evident that a coordinate Bench of this Court took the view that impleading the respondent No.3 therein as the plaintiff No.3 would cause a serious prejudice to the appellant.This Court took the view that no explanation was offered for an inordinate delay of years, which was by the High Court.Even while allowing the appeal filed by the appellant herein, the coordinate Bench of this Court observed that mere delay would not be a ground for rejecting the amendment.However, in the facts of the case, since the parties not being rustic litigants and all the respondents therein being companies and the dispute being a commercial the amendment could not have been permitted after years of the suit, as it would take away the substantial rights of accrued in favour of the appellant (LIC).We are of the view that the judgment and order passed by the coordinate Bench of this Court in the Life Insurance of India (supra) has no application so far as the present appeal is concerned.The appellant herein cannot succeed in the present appeal merely on the strength of the judgment and order passed by this Court in the Life Insurance of India (supra).ORDER II RULE 2 OF THE CPC In the present appeal, the principal argument of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant is that th",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 amendment application should have been by the courts below applying the principle of Order II Rule 2 of the CPC.The said provision is set out below Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure Suit to include the whole claim.-(1) Every suit shall include the whole of the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action but a plaintiff may relinquish any portion of his claim in order to bring the suit within the of any Court.Relinquishment of part of claim.-Where a plaintiff omits to sue in respect of, or relinquishes, any portion of his claim, he shall not afterwards sue in respect of the portion so omitted or relinquished.Omission to sue for one of several reliefs.-A person entitled to more than one relief in respect of the same cause of action may sue for all or any of such reliefs but if he omits, except with the leave of the Court, to sue for all such reliefs, he shall not afterwards sue for any relief so omitted.Explanation.-For the purposes of this rule an obligation and a security for its performance and claims arising under the same obligation shall be to but one cause of action.Illustration A lets a house to B at a yearly rent of Rs.1200.The rent for the whole of the years 1905, 1906 and 1907 is due and unpaid.A sues B in 1908 only for the rent due for 1906.A shall not afterwards sue B for the rent due for 1905 or 1907.The omits to sue and relinquish any portion of his claim give an as to the of the legislature in framing the said rule.The term sue can mean both the filing of the suit and prosecuting the suit to its culmination, depending on the context of the provision.In the present case, the legislature thought it fit to debar a plaintiff from suing afterwards for any relief which he she has omitted without the leave of the court or from suing in respect of any portion of his claim which he relinquishes.Order II Rule 2(1) provides that every suit shall include the whole of the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action.The provision of Order II Rule 2 of the CPC has been well by the Privy Council in the case of Mohd.Khalil Khan Ors.v. Mahbub Ali Mian Ors., AIR 1949 PC 78, held as under The principles laid down in the cases thus far may be thus summarized (1.)the correct test in cases falling under Or.2, r. 2, is whether the claim in the new suit is, in fact, founded on a cause of action distinct from that which was the foundation for the former suit.(Moonshee Buzloor Ruheem v.Begum.)(2.)The cause of action means every fact which will be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment.(Read v.Brown.)(3.)If the to support the two claims is different, then the causes of action are also different.(Brunsden v.Humphrey.)(4.)The causes of action in the two suits may be considered to be the same if in substance they are identical.(Brunsden v.Humphrey.)(5.)The cause of action has no relation whatever to the that may be set up by the defendant, nor does it depend on the character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff.It refers to the media upon which the plaintiff asks the Court to arrive at a conclusion in his favour.(Muss.Chand Kour v. Partab Singh.)This observation was made by Lord Watson in a case under s. 43 of the Act of 1882 (corresponding to Or.2, r. 2), where plaintiff made various claims in the same suit.In Upendra Narain Roy v. Rai Janoki Nath Roy, AIR 1919 Cal 904, a Bench of the Calcutta High Court had an occasion to consider this question.J. has observed As regards the other point it has more ingenuity than substance.It proceeds on the erroneous assumption that the amendment was prohibited by Or.II, r. 2.This Rule does not touch the matter before us.It refers to a case where there has been a suit in which there has been an omission, to sue in respect of portion of a claim, and a has been made in that suit.In that case a second suit in respect of the portion so omitted is barred.That is not the case here.In the present case the suit has not been heard but a claim has been omitted by, it is said, To hold that in such case an amendment should not be allowed would be to hold something which the Rule does not say and which would be absurd.The Rule says he shall not afterwards sue, that is, it that there has been a suit carried to a decision, and a sub-sequent suit.It does not apply to amendment where there has been only one suit.As the Plaintiff had in law a right to apply for an amendment before the conclusion of his suit, it cannot be said that any rights of the Respondent in the Pabna suit are affected.Such a is based on the erroneous assumption that nothing could be done by way of amendment of the Calcutta suit to remove the objection that the claims on the previous mortgage or charge were not sustainable.A case would fall within Or.II, r. 2, only if a Plaintiff fails to apply for amendment before and then brings another suit.The Plaintiffs are not doing that but asking for amendment in the one and only suit they have brought.This is, not a case in which the amendment either affects rights to the other party, or otherwise prejudices him.(emphasis supplied) A Bench of this Court, considering the scope and of Order II Rule 2 of the CPC, in the case of Gurbux Singh v. Bhooralal, AIR 1964 SC 1810, held as under In order that a plea of a Bar under Order 2 Rule 2(3) of the Civil Procedure Code should succeed the defendant who raises the plea must make out (i) that the second suit was in respect of the same cause of action as that on which the previous suit was based (2) that in respect of that cause of action the plaintiff was entitled to more than one relief (3) that being thus entitled to more than one relief the plaintiff, without leave obtained from the Court omitted to sue for the relief for which the second suit had been filed.From this analysis it would be seen that the defendant would have to establish primarily and to start with, the precise cause of action upon which the previous suit was filed, for unless there is identity the cause of action on which the earlier suit was filed and that on which the claim in the latter suit is based there would be no scope for the application of the bar.No doubt, a relief which is sought in a plaint could ordinarily be traceable to a particular cause of action but this might, by no means, be the universal rule.As the plea is a technical bar it has to be established satisfactorily and cannot be presumed merely on basis of inferential reasoning.It is for this reason that we consider that a plea of a bar under Order 2 Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Code can be established only if the defendant files in the pleadings in the previous suit and thereby proves to the Court the identity of the cause of action in the two suits.It is common ground that the pleadings in CS 28 of 1950 were not filed by the appellant in the present suit as in support of his plea under Order 2 Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Code.The learned trial Judge, however, without these pleadings being on the record inferred what the cause of action should have been from the to the previous suit contained in the plaint as a matter of deduction.At the stage of the appeal the learned District Judge noticed this lacuna in the appellants case and pointed out, in our opinion, rightly that without the plaint in the previous suit being on the record, a plea of a bar under Order 2 Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Code was not So far as, Gurbux Singh (supra) is concerned, we may clarify that the entire consideration in the said case by this Court was to the fact that there was a relinquishment of a claim by the plaintiff therein, but the relevant point which was considered by this Court was that the relief had become time barred.The ratio of the said judgment is that the relief being barred by the Order II Rule 2 of the CPC only came in as an adjunct.However, Gurbux Singh (supra) makes it clear that the bar of Order II Rule 2 of the CPC applies only to the subsequent suits.In the light of the principles and the law laid down by the Bench as also the other decisions above, we are of the view that if the two suits and the relief claimed therein are based on the same cause of action then the subsequent suit will become barred under Order II Rule 2 of the CPC.However, we do not find any merit in the raised on behalf of the appellant herein that the amendment application is liable to be by applying the bar under Order II Rule 2 of the CPC.Order II Rule 2 of the CPC cannot apply to an amendment which is sought on an existing suit.In the aforesaid context, we may refer to with approval a decision by the High Court of Delhi in the case of Vaish Cooperative Adarsh Bank Ltd. v. Geetanjali Despande Ors., (2003) 102 DLT 570.Paras 17 and 18 resply indicate that the bar under Order II Rule 2 of the CPC is only for a subsequent suit.These paras read as under Reverting to the preliminary objections raised by the appellant against the of the application for amendment, one would come across with a peculiar plea of proposed amendment being barred under Order II Rule 2 CPC.General rule enacted under Order II Rule 2.(1) CPC is that every suit must include the whole of the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action.Order II Rule 2.(2) precludes a subsequent suit on any part of claim, which had been omitted or relinquished by the plaintiff in an earlier suit based on the same cause of action.Similarly, where the plaintiff is entitled to more than one relief in respect of the same cause of action but omits, except with the leave of the court, to sue for all such reliefs, he is debarred in view of the Order II Rule 2(3) CPC from suing afterwards for any relief so omitted.A plea of bar under Order II Rule 2 CPC is only if the defendant makes out (i) that the cause of action of the second suit is the same on which the previous suit was based, (ii) that in respect of that cause of action, the plaintiff was entitled to more than one relief and that the plaintiff without leave obtained from the Court omitted to sue earlier for the relief for which the second suit is Gurbux Singh v. Bhooralal, AIR 1964 SC 1810).Clearly, Order II Rule 2 CPC enacts a rule barring a second suit in the situation indicated above.Identity of cause of action in the former and subsequent suits is essential before the bar contemplated under Order II Rule 2 CPC is set to operate.Thus, where the claim or reliefs in the second suit are based on a distinct cause of action, Order II Rule 2 CPC would have no application.Order II Rule 2 CPC operates as a bar against a subsequent suit if the requisite conditions for application thereof are satisfied and the field of amendment of pleadings falls far beyond its purview.The plea of amendment being barred under Order II Rule 2 CPC is, thus, misconceived and hence negatived.(emphasis supplied) We are also not impressed by the raised on behalf of the appellant herein that the amendment application is hit by the principle of constructive res judicata.The principle of constructive res judicata has no application in the instant case, since there was no formal adjudication the parties after full hearing.The before this Court has come up at the stage when the courts below allowed the amendment of plaint for the purpose of the amount towards damages in the alternative to the main relief of specific performance of the contract.SPECIFIC RELIEF ACT, 1963 The above takes us now to consider the proviso to Section 21(5) and Section of the Act 1963.The Act 1963 contemplates that in addition to or in of a claim for performance, a plaintiff is entitled to claim compensation.Section 21 of the Act 1963 provides as follows Power to award compensation in certain cases.In a suit for specific performance of a contract, the plaintiff may also claim compensation for its breach in addition to such performance.If, in any such suit, the court decides that specific performance ought not to be granted, but that there is a contract the parties which has been broken by the defendant, and that the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for that breach, it shall award him such compensation accordingly.If, in any such suit, the court decides that specific performance ought to be granted, but that it is not sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case, and that some compensation for breach of the contract should also be made to the plaintiff, it shall award him such compensation accordingly.In determining the amount of any compensation awarded under this section, the court shall be guided by the principles specified in section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872).No compensation shall be awarded under this section unless the plaintiff has claimed such compensation in his plaint Provided that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such compensation in the plaint, the court shall, at any stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just, for including a claim for such compensation.Explanation.-The that the contract has become incapable of specific performance does not preclude the court from exercising the conferred by this section.Under sub-section (2) of Section 21, the court is to award compensation for breach where it holds that there is a contract the parties which was broken by the defendant but in the event, it decides that specific performance ought not to be granted.Sub-section (3) of Section 21 empowers the court to grant compensation for breach in addition to a for specific performance where it is of the view that specific performance alone would not satisfy the justice of the case.Sub-section (5), however, stipulates that compensation cannot be awarded under the section unless the Plaintiff has claimed such compensation in the plaint.This provision is mandatory.The proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 21 dilutes the rigours of the main provision by allowing the plaintiff who has not claimed such compensation in the plaint to amend the plaint at any stage of the proceedings and the court, it has been provided, shall at any stage of the proceedings allow an amendment for including a claim for such compensation on such terms as may be just.In Shamsu Suhara Beevi v. G. Alex Anr., (2004) 8 SCC 569, for instance, this Court held that the High Court erred in granting compensation under Section 21, in addition to the relief of specific performance in the absence of a prayer made to that effect either in the plaint as originally filed or as amended at any stage of the proceedings Section 22 of the Act 1963 contains the following provisions Power to grant relief for partition, refund of earnest money, etc.-(1) anything to the contrary contained in the Code of Civil Procedure,1908, (5 of 1908), any person suing for the specific performance of a contract for the transfer of immovable property may, in an case, ask for- (a) or partition and separate of the property, in addition to such performance or (b) any other relief to which he may be entitled, including the refund of any earnest money or deposit paid or (made by) him, in case his claim for specific performance is refused.No relief under clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall be granted by the Court unless it has been specifically claimed Provided that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such relief in the plaint, the Court shall, at any stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just for including a claim for such relief.The power of the Court to grant relief under clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall be without prejudice to its powers to award compensation under section 21.Section 22 has a provision which overrides the CPC.A plaintiff who claims specific performance of a contract for the transfer of immovable property, may in an case ask for partition and separate of the property, in addition to specific performance.The plaintiff may also claim any other relief including the refund of earnest money or deposit paid, in case the claim for specific performance is refused.Corresponding to the provisions of sub-section (5) of Section 21, sub-section (2) of Section 22 stipulates that such relief cannot be granted by the court unless it has been specifically claimed.However, the proviso requires that the court shall at any stage of the proceedings allow the plaintiff to amend the plaint to claim such relief where it has not been originally claimed on such terms which may appear just.THE SPECIFIC RELIEF (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2018 The Act 1963 was amended in the year 2018 and in Section 21 of the Principal Act, in sub-section (1) the words either in addition to, or in of were and the words in addition to were in their place.As a result, damages are now only in addition to specific performance and not in lieu thereof.This is a of other amendments to the Act 1963 whereby the amending act has eliminated the discretion of courts by Sections 10 and 20 resply of the Principal Act.The aforesaid provisions of the Act 1963 were duly considered by the Bombay High Court in the case of Kahini Pvt.Ltd. v. Mukesh Ors., reported in (2013) 3 Mah LJ 440, Dr. Justice D.Y.Chandrachud, (as His Lordship then was), speaking for the Bench, very lucidly and in the most erudite manner explained as under The object of the legislature in introducing the proviso to sub-section (5) of section 21 and to sub-section (2) of section 22 was to obviate a of the proceedings.In Babu Lal v. Hazari Lal, (1982) 1 SCC 525 AIR 1982 SC 818 the Supreme Court noted that the legislature has given ample power to the Court to allow amendment of the plaint at any stage.(At para 20 page 825).This, the Supreme Court held, would include even the stage of execution.The Supreme Court also held that a mere contract for sale or for that matter, a for specific performance does not confer title on the buyer and that title would pass only upon execution of the While the issue of the Supreme Court held as follows If once we accept the legal position that neither a contract for sale nor a passed on that basis for specific performance of the contract gives any right or title to the and the right and the title to him only on the execution of the deed of sale either by the judgment-debtor himself or by the Court itself in case he fails to the sale deed, it is idle to contend that a valuable right had accrued to the Petitioner merely because a has been passed for the specific performance of the contract.The would start against the only after they had obtained a sale in respect of the disputed property.It is, difficult to accept that a valuable right had accrued to the judgment-debtor by lapse of time.Section 22 has been enacted only for the purpose of avoiding of proceedings which the law Courts always abhor.(At para 21 page 825) The same view was taken by the Supreme Court in a later judgment in Jagdish Singh v. Natthu Singh, (1992) 1 SCC 647 AIR 1992 SC 1604 So far as the proviso to sub-section (5) is concerned, two positions must be kept clearly If the amendment relates to the relief of compensation in lieu of or in addition to specific performance where the plaintiff has not abandoned his relief of specific performance the Court will allow the amendment at any stage of the proceeding.That is a claim for compensation falling under section 21 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and the amendment is one under the proviso to sub-section (5).But different and less liberal standards apply if what is sought by the amendment is the conversion of a suit for specific performance into one for damages for breach of contract in which case section 73 of the Contract Act is invoked.This amendment is under the of R.17,0.6, The fact that sub-section (4) in turn, invokes section 73 of the Contract Act for the principles of and of compensation does not obliterate this (At para 10 page 1608) In the decision in Shamsu Suhara Beevi (supra), while holding that the High Court had erred in granting compensation under section 21, in addition to the relief of the specific performance in the absence of a prayer to that effect, the Supreme Court held that a prayer could have been made to that effect either in the plaint or by amending the plaint at any later stage of the proceeding to include the relief of compensation in addition to the relief of a specific performance.The plaint, however, in that case, was never amended and the order of the High Court was, held to be in These principles have also been noticed in a judgment of a learned Single Judge of this Court in Manohar Dhundiraj Joshi v. Jhunnulal Hariram Yadao, 1983 369.Since the Court is informed that an appeal has been filed against the judgment of the learned Single Judge in G. Bajaj (supra), we are not expressing any opinion on the correctness of that decision.We are, however, of the view that since the legislature has contemplated that an amendment within the meaning of the provisos to section 21(5) and section of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 can be made at any stage of the proceeding, such an amendment would not be barred by Even as a matter of first principle, an application for amendment must be from the cause of action which is sought to be set up by the amendment.As a matter of general principle, though an application for amendment is allowed, the question as to whether the cause of action is within would have to be and upon.While allowing an amendment, it is always open to a Civil Court to direct that the amendment shall not relate back to the of the proceeding.The Court would have to at trial whether the cause of action is within or is barred.Where the legislature has contemplated that the plaint can be amended at any stage of the proceeding as stipulated in the provisos to section 21(5) and section 21(2).Such an amendment of the nature contemplated by those provisions can indeed be brought about at any stage of the proceedings.(emphasis supplied) In the case of B.K.Pillai v. Pillai Anr., 1 SCC 712 relying upon the cases of A.K.Gupta (supra) and Ganesh Trading Co. (supra), this Court held that the court should adopt a liberal approach in the matter of amendment and only when the other side had acquired any legal right due to lapse of time, the amendment should be declined.It has been held as follows All amendments of the pleadings should be allowed which are necessary for determination of the real controversies in the suit provided the proposed amendment does not alter or a new cause of action on the basis of which the original lis was raised or taken.and contradictory allegations in negation to the admitted position of facts or mutually destructive allegations of facts should not be allowed to be incorporated by means of amendment to the pleadings.Proposed amendment should not cause such prejudice to the other side which cannot be compensated by costs.No amendment should be allowed which amounts to or results in defeating a legal right accruing to the opposite party on account of lapse of time.The delay in filing the petition for amendment of the pleadings should be properly compensated by costs and or mistake which, if not fraudulent, should not be made a ground for rejecting the application for amendment of plaint or written In Jagdish Singh v. Natthu Singh, reported in (1992) 1 SCC 647 AIR 1992 SC 1604, this Court had the occasion to deal with the provisions of Section 21 of the Act 1963.While analysing the aforesaid provisions, this Court laid down that if the amendment relates to the relief of compensation in lieu of or in addition to specific performance where the plaintiff has not abandoned his relief of specific performance the court should allow the amendment at any stage of the proceedings since that is a claim for compensation falling under Section 21 of the Act 1963 and the amendment is one under the proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 21.This Court, however, issued a note of caution by laying down that different and less liberal standards would apply if what is sought by the amendment is conversion of a suit for specific performance into one for damages for breach of contract, in which case Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 would get invoked, and then the said amendment would be under the of Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC.This Court further held that when the plaintiff by his option had made specific performance impossible then Section 21 does not entitle him to seek damages.It is also held that in Indian Law when the contract, for no fault of the plaintiff, becomes impossible of performance Section 21 enables award of compensation in lieu and of specific performance.The legal position, in respect of scope and ambit of Section 21 of the Act 1963 is clear and made so more by the ratio of the aforesaid decision of this Court.The plaintiffs in the original plaint claimed for compensation in addition to a for specific performance of the to sell.strictly speaking the provisions of Section 21 of the Act 1963 are not to the facts of the present case.The of the plaintiffs in seeking for amendment of the plaint appears to be to get an enhanced amount of compensation than what was originally claimed in the original plaint which was restricted only to Rs.The aforesaid becomes apparent when the averments made in the application praying for amendment are looked into inasmuch as, the plaintiffs have stated that in view of the fact that in last 30 years there had been a tremendous escalation of the value of the suit property which has an adverse effect on the quantum of damages, compensation, relief sought for the breach of contract by the appellant defendant.According to the plaintiffs the raising of the amount of compensation to Rs.from Rs.as claimed in the original plaint has been in view of undue delay in the prosecution of the suit which was not earlier which in turn has caused more damage to the plaintiffs through the years and they have sought to raise the amount of compensation to the present value as stated above from Rs.However, the argument of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant in regard to the two provisos to above, is quite curious.The argument is that the power of the court to permit the plaintiff to amend the plaint in a suit filed for the specific performance of contract flows from Sections 21 and 22 resply of the Act, 1963 the proviso to the sub-section (5) of Section 21 of the Act 1963 may entitle the plaintiff to amend the plaint, provided the plaintiff has inadvertently or otherwise omitted to pray for compensation.The argument proceeds on the footing that in the present case, as the plaintiff specifically prayed for compensation in the plaint, later if he seeks to amend that part of the relief, the sub- section (5) of Section 21 of the Act 1963 would be an embargo for the court to do so.We do not find any merit in this argument of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant.The two provisos to above, deal with the question of permitting the plaintiff to amend his plaint.It is not, as if, in the absence of these two provisos, it is not permissible in law for the plaintiff to carry out an amendment in his pleading by introducing a relief for enhanced compensation.Rule 17 of Order VI of the CPC does confer power on a Court to allow a party to alter or amend his pleading in such manner and on such terms as may be just.This rule does not stop at that, but it further says that all such amendments should be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy the parties.It is pertinent to note that this provision which empowers the court in its discretion to permit a party to amend his pleadings, was already on the book, when the Specific Relief Act, 1963 was enacted.It can, be presumed that when the latter legislation was on the anvil, the Parliament was aware of this power of the court to permit amendment of pleadings.it cannot be urged that a suit for specific performance falling under the provisions of the Act, 1963 would not be governed by the provisions of the CPC.It is, clear that to such a suit the provisions contained in Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC would apply and a plaintiff who has earlier failed to incorporate the reliefs for compensation or who has incorporated the reliefs for compensation but seeks amendment in the same, could seek the permission of the court to introduce these reliefs by way of amendment.It is important to note that sub-section (5) of Section 21 of the Act 1963 was originally introduced to resolve the confusion over whether the court had the power to grant compensation in a claim for specific performance in absence of any pleading to that effect under the provisions of the Act 1963.Prior to the enactment of the Act 1963 the Law Commission in its 9th Law Commission Report while to the diverse opinions by the High Courts that in no case should compensation be unless it is claimed by a proper pleading.In The Arya Pradeshak Sabha, Sindh, Punjab Bilochistan v. Lahori Mal Ors., (1924) 6 Lah LJ 286 AIR 1924 Lah 713, the Lahore High Court had held that the court has the power to award damages in of or in addition to specific performance even though the plaintiff has not specifically claimed the same in its plaint and written As against, the Madras High Court in Chettiar v. Chettiar, AIR 1951 Mad 282 held that the court could not award damages in absence of a specific claim for damages.In Chettiar (supra), the Madras High Court held that the rationale for not allowing a claim for damages in a suit for specific performance without a specific pleading is based on the principle that the plaintiff must establish its claim for damages and the defendant must be put on notice and correspondingly have an opportunity to adduce that the damages claimed are or that the plaintiff has not suffered any damages.Our final conclusions may be summed up thus Order II Rule 2 CPC operates as a bar against a subsequent suit if the requisite conditions for application thereof are satisfied and the field of amendment of pleadings falls far beyond its purview.The plea of amendment being barred under Order II Rule 2 CPC is, thus, misconceived and hence negatived.All amendments are to be allowed which are necessary for determining the real question in controversy provided it does not cause injustice or prejudice to the other side.This is mandatory, as is apparent from the use of the word shall, in the latter part of Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC.The prayer for amendment is to be allowed if the amendment is required for and proper adjudication of the controversy the parties, and to avoid of proceedings, provided (a) the amendment does not result in injustice to the other side, (b) by the amendment, the parties seeking amendment does not seek to withdraw any clear admission made by the party which confers a right on the other side and (c) the amendment does not raise a time barred claim, resulting in divesting of the other side of a valuable accrued right (in certain situations).A prayer for amendment is generally required to be allowed unless by the amendment, a time barred claim is sought to be introduced, in which case the fact that the claim would be time barred becomes a relevant factor for consideration, the amendment changes the nature of the suit, the prayer for amendment is malafide, or by the amendment, the other side loses a valid In dealing with a prayer for amendment of pleadings, the court should avoid a hypertechnical approach, and is ordinarily required to be liberal especially where the opposite party can be compensated by costs.Where the amendment would enable the court to pin-pointedly consider the dispute and would aid in rendering a more satisfactory decision, the prayer for amendment should be allowed.Where the amendment merely sought to introduce an additional or a new approach without introducing a time barred cause of action, the amendment is liable to be allowed even after expiry of Amendment may be justifiably allowed where it is intended to rectify the absence of material particulars in the plaint.Delay in applying for amendment alone is not a ground to disallow the prayer.Where the aspect of delay is arguable," the prayer for amendment could be allowed and the issue of framed separately for decision.""",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

by Aash Mohamad, son of late Gulam Mohamad.It was as a result of an application filed before the Magistrate under Section 156(3) CrPC.The allegation was that Nusarat Jahan, widow of Gulam Mohamad had sold the property to the Appellants which she was not entitled to sell as after the death of her husband Gulam Mohamad, she had Learned counsel for the Appellants argued that he purchased a piece of land from Nusarat Jahan widow of Gulam Mohamad after payment of due consideration.The sale deed was on 17.3.2017 for a total consideration of 14 lakhs.The Appellants were not in the knowledge of any fact regarding the dispute of the vendor in the family or that she had after the death of her husband thereby putting a scar on her right in the property.In fact, the Appellants were surprised to know about all these facts when they notice in a Civil Suit No.14/2017 filed by the complainant on After filing the civil suit, they filed application under Section 156(3) CrPC before the Magistrate on

mutation of the land in question was in the name of Nusarat Jahan on the basis of which the land in question was sold by her to the appellants.In the FIR, there are no allegations of cheating against the Appellants.The allegations of cheating are only against Nusarat Jahan.In fact, on a plain reading of the FIR, no case is made out against the appellants, hence permitting the trial to continue would result in abuse of process of Court especially when a civil suit filed by the complainant more than a year before filing of application under Section 156(3) CrPC, was already pending.On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that whatever arguments have been raised by the counsel for the appellants needs appreciation of facts.These are factual aspects which are

consideration of 14 lakhs.This is the entire narration of facts mentioned by the complainant in the application under Section 156(3) CrPC as a of which, FIR was A plain reading of the aforesaid FIR shows that there is no allegation whatsoever against the appellants that they are part of any conspiracy or acted in with Nusarat Jahan for purchase of land which was duly recorded in her ownership at the time of registration of sale deed in their favour.It is the admitted case of the complainant that Gulam Mohamad died about seven years before the registration of FIR.Mutation of inheritance was in the records immediately after his death.This must be in the knowledge of other legal heirs of late Gulam Mohamad.Despite their knowledge of the fact that Nusarat Jahan had they did not take any steps

Godfrey Philips (I) Ltd.Ors., - Civil Appeal No.3073 of subsequent purchaser is not entitled to claim lapsing of proceedings under the Act, 2013. the High Court has materially erred in the writ petition by the original writ petitioner subsequent purchaser claiming lapsing of the proceedings under the Act, 2013.2.2 Even otherwise, on merits also, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is unsustainable.While passing the impugned judgment and order and declaring that the proceedings with respect to the land in question has lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013, the High Court has relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal and Anr.(supra), which has been specifically overruled by the Bench of this Court in the case of Indore Authority Vs. and Ors., (2020) 8 SCC 129.In 365 and 366, the Bench of this Court has observed and held as under- Resultantly, the decision in Pune Municipal Corpn.Pune Municipal Corpn.v. Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183 is hereby overruled and all other decisions in which Pune Municipal Corpn.Pune Municipal Corpn.v. Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183 has been followed, are also overruled.The decision in Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn.Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn.v. State of T.N., (2015) 3 SCC 353 cannot be said to be laying down good law, is overruled and other decisions following the same are also overruled.In Indore Authority v. Shailendra (2018) 3 SCC 412, the aspect with respect to the proviso to Section 24(2) and whether or has to be read as nor or as and was not placed for consideration.that decision too cannot prevail, in the light of the in the present judgment.In view of the aforesaid we answer the questions as under 366.1.Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on the date of of the 2013 Act, there is no lapse of proceedings.Compensation has to be under the provisions of the 2013 Act.366.2.In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding the period covered by an interim order of the court, then proceedings shall continue as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the 2013 Act under the 1894 Act as if it has not been 366.3.The word or used in Section 24(2) and compensation has to be read as nor or as and.The lapse of land proceedings under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act takes place where due to inaction of authorities for five years or more prior to of the said Act, the of land has not been taken nor compensation has been paid.In other words, in case has been taken, compensation has not been paid then there is no lapse.Similarly, if compensation has been paid, has not been taken then there is no lapse.366.4.The expression paid in the main part of Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not include a deposit of compensation in court.The of non-deposit is provided in the proviso to Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to majority of landholdings then all (landowners) as on the date of for land under Section 4 of the 1894 Act shall be entitled to compensation in with the provisions of the 2013 Act.In case the obligation under Section 31 of the Land Act, 1894 has not been interest under Section 34 of the said Act can be granted.Non-deposit of compensation (in court) does not result in the lapse of land proceedings.In case of non-deposit with respect to the majority of holdings for five years or more, compensation under the 2013 Act has to be paid to the landowners as on the date of for land under Section 4 of the 1894 Act.366.5.In case a person has been the compensation as provided under Section 31(1) of the 1894 Act, it is not open to him to claim that has lapsed under Section 24(2) due to or non- deposit of compensation in court.The obligation to pay is complete by tendering the amount under Section 31(1).The landowners who had refused to accept compensation or who sought for higher compensation, cannot claim that the proceedings had lapsed under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act.The proviso to Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act is to be treated as part of Section 24(2), not part of Section 24(1)(b).366.7.The mode of taking under the 1894 Act and as contemplated under Section 24(2) is by drawing of inquest report Once award has been passed on taking under Section 16 of the 1894 Act, the land vests in State there is no divesting provided under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act, as once has been taken there is no lapse under Section 24(2).366.8.The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a lapse of proceedings are applicable in case authorities have failed due to their inaction to take and pay compensation for five years or more before the 2013 Act came into force, in a proceeding for land pending with the authority concerned as on The period of of interim orders passed by court has to be excluded in the computation of five years.366.9.Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of concluded proceedings of land Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of of the 2013 Act i.e.It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of taking to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate In view of the above and for the reasons stated above and in view of the Bench decision of this Court in the case of Indore Authority (supra), the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Supreme_Court_2022_917,"Uday Umesh Lalit, CJI Leave granted.This appeal challenges the final judgment and order dated 1.3.2021 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Writ Petition No.25670/2019.The aforestated writ petition was filed by the respondent herein seeking quashing of proceedings against him under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Signature Not Verified 2002 (PML Act, for short).Digitally signed by BABITA PANDEY Date 183043 IST Reason The basic facts which led to the filing of said writ petition stand captured in 2.1 to 2.3 of the judgment under appeal, as under - 2.1 One Andasu Ravinder (A1), IRS, was working as Additional Commissioner of Income Tax, Chennai.On the Central Bureau of Investigation (for brevity the CBI) checked a car that was parked in front of the premises of the said Andasu Ravinders (A1) house on 29.08.2011 and a sum of in cash.It is alleged that Andasu Ravinder (A1) and one Uttam Chand Bohra (A3) were in that car at that time.2.2 During it came to light that the sum of was handed over to the said Andasu Ravinder (A1) by one Kishore (A2), petitioner herein, whose income tax file was pending with Andasu Ravinder (A1) for clearance.Since Kishore (A2) wanted certain benefits, he had paid the sum of as bribe to Andasu Ravinder (A1).2.3 In with this seizure, the CBI an FIR in 2011 A 0033 on 29.08.2011 and after completing the filed charge sheet in C.No.3 of 2013 before the Special Court for the CBI Cases, Chennai, for the offences under Section 120- B IPC and Sections 7, 12, 13(1)(d) r w 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, against Andasu Ravinder (A1), Kishore (A2), Uttam Chand Bohra (A3), (A4), T.Banusekar (A5) and (A6).Since the case by the CBI disclosed the commission of a schedule offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (for brevity the PML Act), the Enforcement Directorate a case in of 2016 and after completing the filed a complaint in of 2018 against Everonn Education Limited and three others including Kishore (A2) for the offences under Section 3 r w 4 of the PML Act, for quashing which, Kishore (A2) is before this Court.As is evident from the quoted portion, the respondent had handed over a sum of (Rupees fifty lakhs only) to a public servant, which transaction and the surrounding were projected in FIR dated 29.8.2011, leading to registration of crime under Section 120B, Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, for short) and Sections 7, 12, 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (PC Act, for short).Later, a case was by the Enforcement Directorate against the accused including the respondent under Sections 3 and 4 of the PML Act.The basic advanced on behalf of the respondent was that the amount in question, as long as it was in the hands of respondent, could not be said to be tainted money that it assumed such character only after it was by the public servant and as such the respondent could not be said to be connected with proceeds of crime and could not be against under the provisions of the PML Act.The was accepted by the High Court with the following observations - For the penal provisions of the PML Act, the accused should have projected the proceeds of a crime as untainted money.In this case, the sum of as long as it was in the hands of Kishore (A2) could not have been stated as a tainted money because it is not the case of the CBI in of 2013 that Kishore (A2) had mobilised via a criminal activity.The sum of became the proceeds of a crime only when Andasu Ravinder (A1) accepted it as a bribe.Even before Andasu Ravinder (A1) could project the sum of as untainted money, the CBI and seized the money in the car on the prosecution of Kishore (A2) under the PML Act, in our considered opinion, is misconceived.The High Court thus allowed the writ petition and quashed the proceedings in PML Act against the respondent, which decision is presently under challenge before us.We have heard Mr. Balbir Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General of India in support of appeal and Mr. S. Nagamuthu, learned senior counsel for the respondent.The of proceeds of crime, as appearing in Section 2(1)(u) of the PML Act is as under - (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, (u) proceeds of crime means any property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence or the value of any such property or where such property is taken or held outside the country, then the property equivalent in value held within the country or abroad Explanation.For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that proceeds of crime include property not only derived or obtained from the scheduled offence but also any property which may directly or indirectly be derived or obtained as a result of any criminal activity relatable to the scheduled offence Sections 3 and 4 of the PML Act which are the principal sections for the present purposes, are as under - Offence of Whosoever directly or indirectly to indulge or knowingly or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in any process or activity connected proceeds of crime including its concealment, or use and projecting or claiming it as untainted property shall be guilty of offence of Explanation.For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that, a person shall be guilty of offence of money- laundering if such person is found to have directly or indirectly to indulge or knowingly or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in one or more of the following or connected with proceeds of crime, namely (a) concealment or (b) or (c) or (d) use or (e) projecting as untainted property or (f) claiming as untainted property, in any manner whatsoever the process or activity connected with proceeds of crime is a activity and continues till such time a person is directly or indirectly enjoying the proceeds of crime by its concealment or or or use or projecting it as untainted property or claiming it as untainted property in any manner whatsoever.Punishment for Whoever commits the offence of shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine Provided that where the proceeds of crime involved in relates to any offence specified under 2 of Part A of the Schedule, the provisions of this section shall have effect as if for the words which may extend to seven years, the words which may extend to ten years had been 8 of the Part-A of the Schedule to the PML Act deals with offences under the PC Act and said is to the following effect - 8 OFFENCES UNDER THE PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION ACT, 1988 (49 of 1988) Section Description of offence Offence relating to public servant being bribed.7A.Taking undue to influence public servant by corrupt or means or by of personal influence.Offence relating to bribing a public servant.Offence relating to bribing a public servant by a commercial organisation Person in charge of commercial organisation to be guilty of offence.Public servant obtaining undue without consideration from person concerned in proceeding or transacted by such public servant.Punishment for abetment of offences.Criminal misconduct by a public servant.Punishment for habitual offender.The respondent stands charged for having committed offence of conspiracy to commit offences punishable under Sections 7, 12, 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the PC Act.The controversy in the instant matter is not with regard to his involvement in the offence punishable under the PC Act, but raises a question whether the respondent can be against under the provisions of the PML Act.The of proceeds of crime in PML Act, inter alia, means any property derived or obtained by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence.The offences punishable under Sections 7, 12 and 13 are scheduled offences, as is evident from 8 of Part-A of the Schedule to the PML Act.Any property thus derived as a result of criminal activity relating to offence mentioned in said 8 of Part-A of the Schedule would certainly be proceeds of crime.The further question to be answered is whether the role played by respondent could come within the purview of Section 3 of the PML Act?Said Section 3 states, inter alia, that whoever knowingly or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in any process or activity connected with proceeds of crime including its concealment, or use shall be guilty of offence of (emphasis by us).It is true that so long as the amount is in the hands of a bribe giver, and till it does not get impressed with the requisite intent and is actually handed over as a bribe, it would definitely be untainted money.If the money is handed over without such intent, it would be a mere If it is by the public servant, the offence would be of or species thereof but certainly not of bribe.The crucial part is the requisite intent to hand over the amount as bribe and normally such intent must necessarily be or prior to the moment the amount is handed over.Thus, the requisite intent would always be at the core before the amount is handed over.Such intent having been well before the amount is actually handed over, the person concerned would certainly be involved in the process or activity connected with proceeds of crime including inter alia, the aspects of or thereof.By handing over money with the intent of giving bribe, such person will be or will knowingly be a party to an activity connected with the proceeds of crime.Without such active on part of the person concerned, the money would not assume the character of being proceeds of crime.The relevant from Section 3 of the PML Act are thus wide enough to cover the role played by such person.On a bare perusal of the complaint made by the Enforcement Directorate, it is quite clear that the respondent was prima facie involved in the activity connected with the proceeds of crime.The view taken by the High Court that the respondent cannot be held liable for the offence under the PML Act is thus completely incorrect.The observations made by us regarding involvement of the respondent are prima facie in nature and for considering whether the allegations made by the prosecution if accepted to be true at this stage, would make out an offence or not.to say that, on facts, the matter shall be considered purely on merits at the stage(s).",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18.02.2017 i.e.on the next day of the sale dated the High Court has committed an in observing and holding that there was a breach of Rule 9(3) of the Rules, 2002.6.4 Similarly, the High Court has also erred in holding that there was a breach of Rule 9(4) of the Rules, 2002.The High Court has held so by observing that the auction purchaser did not deposit the balance 75 of the sale price on or before 15th day of confirmation of sale.However, it is required to be noted that by communication letter dated the secured creditor Bank directed the auction purchaser to deposit the balance 75 of the bid amount within 15 days and the auction purchaser deposited the balance 75 of the sale price on 23.03.2017, i.e., on the 15 th day from the date of communication by the secured creditor Bank to deposit balance 75 of the bid amount within 15 days.As per Rule 9(4) of the Rules, 2002, the balance amount of purchase price payable shall be paid by the purchaser to the Authorized Officer on or before 15 th day of confirmation of sale of the immovable property or such period, in any case not three months.the communication dated can be said to be the period by the secured creditor Bank.on the 15 th day from the date of communication dated when the entire 75 of the sale price was deposited, it can be said that the entire sale price was deposited within the time prescribed under Rules 9(3) and (4) of the Rules, 2002. the High Court has committed an in holding that there was a breach of Rules 9(3) (4) of the Rules, 2002.Now, so far as with respect to remaining properties / secured viz.Item Nos.3 and 9 to 12 and the on behalf of the that as the said scheduled properties were agricultural properties, the said properties were from the provisions of the SARFAESI Act in view of Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that except the records, the did not file any to show that the agricultural work was being done in the said properties.On the contrary, the secured creditor produced the photographs to show that there was no agricultural being done and no agricultural activity was going on.The High Court has observed and held that the scheduled properties in question were from the provisions of SARFAESI Act in view of Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act on the ground that the records and and the title deeds show that the properties were agricultural properties lands and that no is produced by the secured creditor that these properties are non- agricultural lands and have been put to non-agricultural use after obtaining permission from the competent authorities.the High Court has shifted the burden upon the secured creditor to prove that the properties are non-agricultural lands.The view taken by the High Court is just contrary to the two decisions of this Court in the case of Blue Coast Hotels Limited and Others (Supra) and K. Pappireddiyar and Another (Supra).In both the aforesaid decisions, this Court has specifically observed and held after considering the object and purpose of Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act that merely because in the records the secured properties are shown as agricultural land is not sufficient to Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act.In the aforesaid decision, it is specifically observed and held that for the purpose of Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act, the properties in question ought to be actually used as agricultural lands at the time when the security interest was created.In the case of Blue Coast Hotels Limited and Others (Supra), it is also further observed by this Court that since no security interest can be created in respect of agricultural lands and yet it was so created, goes to show that the parties did not treat the land as agricultural land and that the debtor offered the land as security on this basis.After following the decision of this Court in the case of Blue Coast Hotels Limited and Others (Supra), in the case of K. Pappireddiyar and Another (Supra), it is observed and held in 8 and 9 as under The expression security interest, both before and after the amendment, excludes what is specified in Section 31.Clause (i) of Section 31 stipulates that the provisions of the Act will not be applicable to any security interest created in agricultural land.The dictionary in Section 2 does not contain a of the expression agricultural land.Whether a particular piece of land is agricultural in nature is a question of fact.In the decision of this Court in Blue Coast Hotels Ltd.,4 a security interest was created in respect of several parcels of land which were meant to be a part of a single unit, for establishing a hotel in Goa.Some of the parcels were purchased by the debtor from agriculturists and were as agricultural lands in the records.The debtor had applied to the authority for the conversion of the land to non-agricultural use, but the applications were pending.This Court held that the fact that the debtor had created a security interest was of the position that the parties did not treat the land as agricultural land.The undisputed position was that the hotel was located on sq m of land of which 2335 sq m were used for growing and fruits for captive consumption.In this background, the two-Judge Bench of this Court held that The mortgage is thus intended to cover the entire property of the Goa Hotel.Prima facie, apart from the fact that the parties understood that the lands in question are not agricultural, it also appears that having regard to the use to which they are put and the purpose of such use, they are indeed not agricultural.The Court further held that (SCC OnLine SC para 57) 57. having regard to the character of the land the purpose for which it is set apart, we are of the view that the land in question is not an agricultural land.The High Court misdirected5 itself in holding that the land was an agricultural land merely because it stood as such in the entries, even though the application made for such conversation lies pending till date.The of land in the records as agricultural is not or conclusive of the question whether the SARFAESI Act does or does not apply.Whether a parcel of land is agricultural must be as a matter of fact from the nature of the land, the use to which it was being put on the date of the creation of the security interest and the purpose for which it was set apart.7.1 The purpose of enacting Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act has been considered by this Court in the case of Blue Coast Hotels Ltd. (Supra) in 36, which reads as under The purpose of enacting Section 31(i) and the meaning of the term agricultural land assume This provision, like many others is intended to protect agricultural land held for agricultural purposes by agriculturists from the provisions of this Act, which provides for of security interest without of the Court.The plain of the provision is to exempt agricultural land from the provisions of the Act.In other words, the creditor cannot enforce any security interest created in his favour without of the court or tribunal, if such security interest is in respect of agricultural land.The exemption thus protects agriculturists from losing their source of livelihood and income i.e.the agricultural land, under the drastic provision of the Act.It is also intended to deter the creation of security interest over agricultural land as defined in Section 2(1)(zf)35.Thus, security interest cannot be created in respect of property specified in Section 31.7.2 Thus, as per the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid two decisions, only in a case where the secured property is actually put to use as agricultural land and solely on the basis of the records / and once the secured property is put as a security by way of mortgage etc.meaning thereby the same was not treated as agricultural land, such properties cannot be said to be from the provisions of the SARFAESI Act under Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act.Applying the law laid down in the aforesaid two decisions to the facts of the case on hand and when no was led at all on behalf of the that the secured properties in question were actually put to use as agricultural land and or any agricultural activity was going on, the High Court has committed an in applying Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act and quashing and setting aside the entire Notice, Auction Notice as well as Sale etc.7.3 The High Court has also materially erred in shifting the burden upon the secured creditor to prove that the properties were not non-agricultural lands or have been put to non-agricultural use.When it was the case on behalf of the that in view of Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act, the properties were agricultural lands, the same were being from the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, the burden was upon the to prove that the secured properties were agricultural lands and actually being used as agricultural lands and or agricultural were going on.the High Court has materially erred in shifting the burden upon the secured creditor to prove that the properties are non-agricultural lands or have been put to non-agricultural use.In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is unsustainable and the same to be quashed and set aside.Accordingly, the impugned judgment and order dated passed by the High Court for the State of at Hyderabad in Writ Petition is hereby quashed and set aside and the judgment and order dated 16.05.2019 passed by the Debts Recovery Tribunal-I, Hyderabad SA is hereby restored.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High Court, Calcutta.TRUE COPY (Emphasis Before adverting to the rival with to application under Section 156(3), within the parameters, we think it only to refer to the following decisions of this Court in respect to the scope of of power under Section 482, Cr.P.C 5.1 In Paramjeet Batra v. State of Ors.1, this Court held- While exercising its under Section 482 of the Code of the High Court has to be cautious.This power is to be used sparingly and only for the purpose of preventing abuse of the process of any court or 1 (2013) 11 SCC 673 Page 11 of 29 otherwise to secure ends of justice.Whether a complaint a criminal offence or not depends upon the nature of the facts alleged therein.Whether essential ingredients of criminal offence are present or not has to be judged by the High Court.A complaint disclosing civil transactions may also have a criminal texture.But the High Court must see whether a dispute which is essentially of a civil nature is given a cloak of criminal offence.In such a situation, if a civil remedy is and is, in fact, adopted as has happened in this case, the High Court should not hesitate to quash the criminal proceedings to prevent abuse of process of the court.5.2 In Vesa Holdings Private Limited and Anr.v. State of Kerala and Ors.2, it was held that - It is true that a given set of facts may make out a civil wrong as also a criminal offence and only because a civil remedy may be to the complainant that itself cannot be a ground to quash a criminal proceeding.The real test is whether the allegations in the complaint disclose the criminal offence of cheating or not.In the 2 (2015) 8 SCC 293 Page 12 of 29 present case there is nothing to show that at the very inception there was any on behalf of the accused persons to cheat which is a condition for an offence under Section 420 IPC.In our view the complaint does not disclose any criminal offence at all.The criminal proceedings should not be encouraged when it is found to be mala fide or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.The superior courts while exercising this power should also strive to serve the ends of justice.In our opinion in view of these facts allowing the police to continue would amount to an abuse of the process of the court and the High Court committed an in refusing to the power under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code to quash the proceedings.5.3 In Kapil Aggarwal and Ors.v. Sanjay Sharma and Ors.3, this Court held that Section 482 is designed to achieve the purpose of ensuring that criminal proceedings are not permitted to into weapons of harassment.3 (2021) 5 SCC 524 Page 13 of 29 5.4 In the decision in State of v. Bhajan Lal4, a two Judge Bench of this Court considered the provisions as also the earlier decisions and held as under - Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie any offence or make out a case against the accused.Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused.Where, the allegations in the FIR do not a cognizable offence but only a offence, no is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just 4 AIR 1992 SC 604 Page 14 of 29 conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is to the and of the proceedings and or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and or where the proceeding is maliciously with an ulterior motive for wreaking on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.5.5 In Neeharika Pvt.Ltd. v. State of and Others5, a three Judge Bench of this Court laid down the following principles of law- From the aforesaid decisions of this Court, right from the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Nazir Ahmad (supra), the following principles of law Police has the right and duty under the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure contained in Chapter XIV of the Code to investigate into cognizable offences 5 2021 SCC OnLine SC 315 Page 15 of 29 ii) Courts would not thwart any into the cognizable offences However, in cases where no cognizable offence or offence of any kind is disclosed in the first information report the Court will not permit an to go on iv) The power of quashing should be sparingly with in the rarest of rare cases.(The rarest of rare cases standard in its application for quashing under Section 482 is not to be confused with the norm which has been formulated in the context of the death penalty, as explained previously by this Court) While examining an FIR complaint, quashing of which is sought, the court cannot embark upon an enquiry as to the or or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR complaint vi) Criminal proceedings ought not to be scuttled at the stage vii) Quashing of a complaint FIR should be an exception and a rarity than an ordinary rule Ordinarily, the courts are barred from usurping the of the police, since the two organs of the State operate in two specific spheres of The inherent power of the court is, however, recognised to secure the ends of justice or prevent the above of the process by Section 482 ix) The functions of the judiciary and the police are complementary, not overlapping Page 16 of 29 Save in exceptional cases where would result in miscarriage of justice, the Court and the judicial process should not at the stage of of offences xi) and inherent powers of the Court do not confer an on the Court to act according to its whims or caprice xii) The first information report is not an encyclopaedia which must disclose all facts and details relating to the offence reported.when the by the police is in progress, the court should not go into the merits of the allegations in the FIR.Police must be permitted to complete the It would be premature to pronounce the conclusion based on hazy facts that the complaint FIR does not to be investigated or that it amounts to abuse of process of law.During or after if the officer finds that there is no substance in the application made by the complainant, the officer may file an report summary before the learned Magistrate which may be considered by the learned Magistrate in with the known procedure The power under Section 482 is very wide, but conferment of wide power requires the court to be cautious.It casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the court xiv) However, at the same time, the court, if it thinks fit, regard being had to the parameters of quashing and the self-restraint imposed by law, more particularly the parameters laid down by this Court in the cases of R.P.Page 17 of 29 Kapur (supra) and Bhajan Lal (supra), has the to quash the FIR complaint and xv) When a prayer for quashing the FIR is made by the alleged accused, the court when it the power under Section 482 only has to consider whether or not the allegations in the FIR disclose the commission of a cognizable offence and is not required to consider on merits whether the allegations make out a cognizable offence or not and the court has to permit the agency police to investigate the allegations in the FIR.We will now, carefully scan the application filed by the respondent herein which was forwarded for under Section 156 (3), Cr.P.C to consider whether the appellant is justified in taking up the that the allegations raised did not contain the ingredients to the alleged offences or whether the respondent had made out a prima facie case for In that regard it is worthwhile to take note of the fact that the respondent herein has alleged commission of offences under Sections 323, 384, 406, 423, 467, 468, 420 and 120B, IPC against the appellants.We will refer to the ingredient to such offences to consider the said question.Page 18 of 29 6.1 The basic ingredients to bring home the accusations under the alleged offences are Offence punishable under Section 323, IPC.causation of hurt by another person (ii) that he caused such hurt voluntarily that such a case is not covered under Section 334, IPC.Offence of extortion punishable under Section 384, IPC.putting a person in fear of injury to himself or another (ii) dishonestly inducing a person so put in fear to deliver to any person any property, or valuable security.Offence of criminal breach of trust punishable under Section 406, IPC.of the property or any dominion over property with accusation (ii) The person entrusted Page 19 of 29 dishonestly or converting to his own use that property or dishonestly using or disposing that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust or causing sufferance to any other person so to do.Offence punishable under Section 423, IPC.The essential ingredients to an offence under Section 423, IPC is that the sale deed or deed subjecting an immovable property to a charge was contained a false relating to the consideration or relating to the persons or whose use or benefit, it was intended to operate.Thus, it is evident that Section 423, IPC deals with twin specific frauds in the matter of execution of deeds or instruments of transfer or charge, idest, (i) false recital as to consideration or false recital as to the name of beneficiary.Offence punishable under Section 467, IPC.Page 20 of 29 Virtually, the offence under Section 467 is an form of the offence under Section 466, IPC.The essential ingredients to the offence punishable under this Section are (i) commission of forgery (ii) that such commission of forgery must be in relation to a document purporting to be (a) a valuable property or (b) a will or (c) an authority to adopt a son or (d) which purports to give authority to any person to make or transfer any valuable security or (e) the the principle, interest or thereon or (f) to or deliver any money, movable property or valuable security, or any document purporting to be an acquittance or receipt acknowledging the payment of money, or (g) an acquittance or receipt for the delivery of any movable property or valuable security.Offence punishable under Section 468, IPC.Commission of forgery, (ii) that he did so that the document or electronic record forged shall be used for the purpose of cheating.Offence punishable under Section 420, IPC.Page 21 of 29 To the said offence there must be deception i.e., the accused must have someone that by such deception the accused must induce a person to deliver any property or (ii) to make, alter, destroy a whole or part of the valuable security or anything which is signed or sealed and which is capable of being converted into a valuable property or that the accused must have done so dishonestly.The offence punishable under Section 120B, IPC, to criminal conspiracy, there must be two or more persons.The should be to do or cause to be done some act, or some act which is not by means, provided that where the is other than one to commit an offence, the prosecution must further prove or (iv) that some act besides the was done by or more of the parties in pursuance of it.Now, the question is whether the allegations in the aforesaid application are sufficient to the alleged offences.Page 22 of 29 We have already extracted the said application filed by the respondent against the appellants in its entirety.At the outset, it is to be noted that in the affidavit accompanying the application, the respondent has stated thus- I have not placed this incident before any Court In the application, obviously, it is stated that he is one of the trustees of Bagla Sundari Memorial Trust at and under the said trust there is a high school by name of Rose Bank Educare and he is the Secretary of the said school.The recital in 2 of the application filed by the respondent would reveal his case that the accused persons kept him in dark and without giving any information by the said trust deed got the same on 12.07.2016 and removed him from the said post.It is in this context that the aforesaid in the aforesaid affidavit It is the case of the appellants that in regard to his removal from the post of Secretary of the school, the respondent had title suit No.363 of 2015, praying therein for a declaration that he is the Secretary of the school and the said suit is still pending.Page 23 of 29 Despite the of the said suit and its pendency before the First Court of Civil Judge, Junior the respondent made such a in the affidavit.That apart, what is stated in the application is that he is the Secretary of the school, run by the trust.The materials on record pertaining to the said pleadings in the Civil Suit, produced in this proceeding would reveal that the respondent was in fact ousted from the membership of the trust.In the counter affidavit filed in this proceeding, the respondent has virtually admitted the pendency of the suit filed against his removal from the post of Secretary and the trusteeship and its pendency.The factum of passing of adverse orders in the interlocutory applications in the said Civil Suit as also the prima facie finding and conclusion arrived at by the Civil Court that the respondent stands removed from the post of Secretary and also from the trusteeship are also not disputed therein.Then, the question is why would the respondent conceal those relevant aspects?The indisputable and undisputed facts (admitted in the counter-affidavit by the respondent) Page 24 of 29 would reveal the of the civil dispute on removal of the respondent from the post of Secretary of the school as also from the trusteeship.Obviously, it can only be taken that since the removal from the office of the Secretary and the trusteeship was the causative incident, he concealed the pendency of the civil suit to cover up the civil nature of the dispute.By non-disclosure the respondent has, in troth, concealed the of a pending civil suit him and the appellants herein before a competent civil court which obviously is the causative incident for the respondents allegation of perpetration of the aforesaid offences against the appellants.We will deal with it further and also its impact a little later.There cannot be any doubt with respect to the position that in order to cause registration of an and consequential based on the same the petition filed under Section 156(3), must satisfy the essential ingredients to the alleged offences.In other words, if such allegations in the petition are vague and are not specific with respect to the alleged offences it cannot lead Page 25 of 29 to an order for registration of an and on the accusation of commission of the offences alleged.As noticed the respondent alleged commission of offences under Sections 323, 384, 406, 423, 467, 468, 420 and 120B, IPC against the appellants.A bare perusal of the said allegation and the ingredients to them, as adverted to would reveal that the allegations are vague and they did not carry the essential ingredients to the alleged offences.There is absolutely no allegation in the complaint that the appellants herein had caused hurt on the respondent so also, they did not reveal a case that the appellants had put the respondent in fear of injury either to himself or another or by putting him under such fear or injury, dishonestly induced him to deliver any property or valuable security.The same is the position with respect to the alleged offences punishable under Sections 406, 423, 467, 468, 420 and 120 B, IPC.The ingredients to the alleged offence to and the nature of the allegations contained in the application filed by the respondent would undoubtedly make it clear Page 26 of 29 that the respondent had failed to make specific allegation against the appellants herein in respect of the aforesaid offences.The factual position thus would reveal that the genesis as also the purpose of criminal proceedings are nothing but the aforesaid incident and further that the dispute involved is essentially of civil nature.The appellants and the respondents have given a cloak of criminal offence in the issue.In such when the respondent had already resorted to the civil remedy and it is pending, going by the decision in Paramjit Batra (supra), the High Court would have quashed the criminal proceedings to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court but for the concealment.In the aforesaid coupled with the fact that in respect of the issue involved, which is of civil nature, the respondent had already approached the civil court by a civil suit and it is pending, there can be no doubt with respect to the fact that the on the part of the respondent is to use the criminal proceedings as weapon of harassment against the appellants.The indisputable facts that the Page 27 of 29 respondent has filed the pending title suit in the year 2015, he got no case that he obtained an interim relief against his removal from the office of Secretary of the School Managing Committee as also the trusteeship, that he filed the stated application for an order for only in April, 2017 together with absence of a case that despite such removal he got a right to get informed of the affairs of the school and also the trust, would only support the said conclusion.For all these reasons, we are of the considered view that this case invites invocation of the power under Section 482 to quash the FIR based on the direction of the Magistrate Court in the afore-stated application and all further proceeding in pursuance thereof.Also, we have no hesitation to hold that permitting of the criminal proceedings against the appellants in the aforesaid would result in abuse of the process of Court and also in miscarriage of justice.In the result, the registration of FIR No.189 of 2017 dated at Police Station against the appellants herein and all further proceeding based on Page 28 of 29 the same qua the appellants are quashed and set aside.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

approved the purchase of a quantum of 500 MW power on long term basis as against the quantum of MW for which PPAs had already been 2.18 On the basis of the decision recommendation of the EAC and the direction issued by the Government of RVPN filed an application under Regulation 7 of the RERC (Power Purchase Procurement Process of Regulations 2004 to as RERC Regulations 2004) in Petition No.431 of 2013, to bring on record the EAC decision recommendation and the Government of approval.In the said application, inter alia, it was prayed for adoption of tariff and approval of the reduced quantum of 500 MW of power to be purchased as against the original MW of power for which PPAs had already been with the bidders.2.19 Vide order dated 22nd July 2015 in Petition No.431 of 2013, the State Commission held that the quantum of only 500 MW power was liable to be approved considering the demand in the State as by the EAC.The State Commission also approved the tariff quoted by the L-1 to L-3 bidders.2.20 Aggrieved by the reduction of quantum by the State Commission, the L-2 and L-3 bidders appeals before the learned Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to as the learned APTEL) being Appeal Nos.235 of 2015 and 191 of 2015 2.21 Two separate appeals were also by the L-4 and L- 5 bidders, being Appeal No.264 of 2015 and Appeal No.202 of 2015 wherein apart from challenging the reduction of quantum by the State Commission from MW to 500 MW, the increase in quantum granted to the L-1, L-2 and L-3 bidders was also challenged.Vide order dated 2nd February 2018, the learned APTEL allowed the Appeal Nos.191 of 2015 and 235 of 2015, filed by the L-3 and L-2 bidders, holding that the reduction of quantum by the State Commission from MW to 500 MW was incorrect.It, directed the State Commission to pass consequential orders for approving the PPAs for the L-2 and L-3 bidders for the higher quantum which was negotiated.2.23 The order of the learned APTEL dated 2nd February 2018, was challenged by the present appellants before this Court by way of Civil Appeal Nos.3481-3482 of 2018, on the ground that the RFP quantum cannot be restored from 500 MW to MW.Subsequently, Civil Appeal Nos.of 2018 also came to be filed by L-5 bidder- SKS Power Generation Limited to as SKS Power), on the ground that the State Commission could not have permitted the procurement of higher quantum by the L-2 and L-3 bidders.2.24 Vide order dated 25th April 2018, the said Civil Appeals were disposed of by this Court, upholding the decision of the learned APTEL, setting aside the reduction of quantum of procurement from MW to 500 MW after the bidding process was over.However, this Court held that the decision of the learned APTEL on the quantum to be procured from bidders was liable to be and that the quantum originally offered by the bidders in the bidding process has to be taken into consideration and increase in quantum by means of negotiation was not permissible.Insofar as L-4 and L-5 bidders are concerned, since the tariff quoted was not considered at any stage by either the or by RVPN or by the State Commission, this Court directed the State Commission to go into the issue of approval for adoption of tariff with regard to L-4 and L-5 bidders.2.25 Subsequent to the judgment and order dated 25th April 2018, passed by this Court, the BEC came to a finding that the tariffs quoted by the L-4 and L-5 bidders were not aligned to the prevailing market prices.2.26 In the meantime, vide order dated 19th November 2018, this Court, on an application filed by RVPN, directed the State Commission to go into the issue of adoption of tariff in terms of Section 63 of the Electricity Act and the law laid down by this Court under the said provision.2.27 Vide order dated 26th February 2019, the State Commission held that the tariffs offered by the L-4 and L-5 bidders were not aligned to the prevailing market prices.2.28 Being aggrieved by the same, SKS Power (L-5 bidder) challenged the above order dated 26th February 2019 before the learned APTEL by way of Appeal No.224 of 2019.2.29 Vide the judgment and order dated 3rd February 2020, the learned APTEL allowed the appeal of the L-5 bidder SKS Power and held that the State Commission had to necessarily adopt the tariff, and had no power to consider whether the tariff was aligned to market prices.2.30 Aggrieved by the same, the present appellants have filed Civil Appeal No.1937 of 2020 and Civil Appeal No.2721 of 2020.Initially, the present appeals were tagged along with the said appeals.However, vide order dated 10th October 2023, the same have been de-tagged.2.31 On an interlocutory application being I.A.No.83693 of 2020 filed by L-5 bidder-SKS Power in Civil Appeal No.2721 of 2020, an interim order 28th 2020, came to be passed by this Court, holding that the L-5 bidder was entitled to supply power to the appellants at the tariff of Rs.2.88 per unit.2.32 It appears that subsequently on 14th 2020, a writ petition being Writ Petition No.14815 of 2020 came to be filed by the respondent No.1-MB Power before the High Court, seeking following relief Issue Writ or order or direction in the nature of declaration or or any other writ or direction declaring Rule 69(2)(b) of the RTPP Rules as ultra vires Article 14, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the of India as well as Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 Issue Writ or order or direction in the nature of mandamus directing the Respondent Nos.1-4 to immediately issue a Letter of Intent in favour of the Petitioner, sign the power Purchase with the Petitioner as per its bid tariff, take steps for adoption of tariff of the Petitioner and immediately commence supply of power Pass such further order(s) as this Honble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and of the instant case in the interest of justice.2.33 In the appeals filed by the present appellants, i.e., Civil Appeal Nos.1937 of 2020 and 2721 of 2020, respondent No.1- MB Power filed an application for impleadment, on the ground that the issue of role of the State Commission in adoption of tariff being by this Court in the said appeals would have an impact on the writ petition filed by it before the High Court.2.34 Vide order dated 19th April 2021, this Court directed the said application for impleadment to be considered at the stage of hearing of the said appeals.2.35 By the impugned judgment and order, the said writ petition filed by MB Power has been allowed by the High Court in terms of the aforesaid directions.2.36 Hence the present appeals.CIVIL APPEAL NO.4612 OF 2023 This appeal filed by Urja Vikas Nigam Limited to as RUVNL) challenges the order dated 1st June 2023, passed by the learned APTEL, whereby the learned APTEL has stayed the operation of the order dated 31 st March 2023, passed by the State Commission in Petition No.RERC-2097 of 2023.The facts, in brief, leading to the filing of Civil Appeal No.4612 of 2023, are as under

2023 for the stay of the order.4.6 Vide impugned order dated 1st June 2023, the learned APTEL stayed operation of the order passed by the State Commission and directed that in the bidding process for procurement of 160 MW of power on medium term basis the bid shall neither be finalized nor shall any Letter of Intent be issued pursuant to the opening of the bids.4.7 Aggrieved thereby, the RUVNL has filed the present appeal.Vide order dated 26th 2023, this Court had permitted the appellant to proceed further with the tender process for procurement of 160 MW of power for 5 years on the basis of model bidding documents for medium term procurement.Vide order dated 10th October 2023, this Court had been informed that pursuant to the aforesaid order dated 26th 2023, bids had been opened and the lowest bid was at Rs.5.30 per unit.As a result, this Court had clarified that the pendency of the present appeal would not come in the way of the appellant in the tender and executing power purchase with the bidders and the appellant would be at liberty to do so in order to overcome the difficulty of power shortage.The order of the learned APTEL dated 1st June 2023 basically relies on the judgment of the Bench of the High Court of Judicature for bench at Jaipur, passed in B.Civil Writ Petition No.14815 of 2020, which is a subject matter of challenge in Civil Appeal Nos.6503 of and 6502 of As such, the result of Civil Appeal No.4612 of 2023 would depend upon the outcome of Civil Appeal Nos.6503 of and 6502 of OF THE APPELLANTS We have heard Shri P. learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants, and Dr.A.M. Singhvi and Shri C.S.learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents.Shri at the outset, submits that the writ petition, filed by the respondent No.1-MB Power, was not before the High Court in its original under Article 226 of the of India.It is submitted that, if the respondent No.1-MB Power had any grievance, it could have either approached the State Commission or the learned APTEL.He submits that this Court in the case of PTC India Limited v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, Through Secretary1 has held that the Electricity Act is an exhaustive code on all matters electricity.The Electricity Act provides for the forum for adjudication of all disputes a generator and the As such, the respondent No.1-MB Power, if had any grievance, ought to have filed an application before the State Commission or the 1 (2010) 4 SCC INSC 146 learned APTEL and it could not have approached the High Court directly in its writ Shri further submitted that though L-1 to L-5 bidders have continuously been their grievances from 2013 onwards, the respondent No.1-MB Power, since it was not short-listed, had taken no steps from 2013 onwards.It is submitted that, as a matter of fact, the bid of L-7 bidder was returned and on 6th January 2015, the Bid Bond bank guarantee was also directed to be not Still, it kept silent for about 6 years.He further submits that even after the judgment and order was passed by this Court on 25th April 2018, respondent No.1-MB Power did not take any steps for about two years, and for the first time, on 14th 2020, it filed a writ petition before the High Court.As such, it is clear that the respondent No.1-MB Power had acquiesced the direction by the appellants dated 6th January 2015 not to renew the Bid Bond bank guarantee.Shri submits that the writ petition was liable to be on the ground of delay and laches itself.Shri further submits that the term bidder has been defined in the RFP.It is submitted that the bidder(s) by the authorized pursuant to the RFP for supply of power by itself or through the project company as per the terms of the RFP, and to whom a LoI has been issued, can only be termed as the bidder.Since no LoI was issued to the respondent No.1-MB Power, it could not be construed as a bidder.Shri submits that the theory of filling the bucket, as put forth by the respondent No.1-MB Power, has no basis either in the RFP or in the Bidding Guidelines.It is further submitted that the said theory is a dangerous inasmuch as, it is that the would be obliged to accept the bids of lower ranked financial bids, of the exorbitant tariff quoted by them.Shri has given an illustration to that effect that, if in a bid to procure MW, 2 bidders can be put forward as stalking horses who would bid lower tariffs and are ranked as L-1 and L-2.L-3 onwards can quote exorbitant tariffs which are not aligned to market prices.He submits that this specious theory of filling the bucket, which would oblige the to go to the last bidder, of their tariffs being completely exorbitant, is very dangerous.It is submitted that, in any case, clause 3.5.12 of the RFP enables the to reject any bid where the quoted tariff is not aligned to market prices.Shri further submits that the directions issued by this Court vide order dated 25th April 2018, were specifically restricted to L-1 to L-5 bidders, which were It is submitted that the of the respondent No.1-MB Power that the order of this Court dated 25th April 2018 was an order in rem is erroneous.Relying on the judgment of this Court in the case of R. and others v. Syed Abdul Wajid since and others2, Shri submits that the judgment in rem settles the destiny of the res itself.Whereas an order in personam the rights of persons before the Court and binds only the parties to the lis.Reliance in this 2 (1963) 3 SCR 22AIR 1963 SC 11962 INSC 205 respect is also placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of Deccan Paper Mills Company Limited v. Regency Mahavir Properties Ors.3 Shri further submits that the reliance by the respondents on the certificate, which certified the bid evaluation process was carried out in conformity with the provisions of the RFP, and, it is not permissible to go into the determination of tariff is incorrect.He submits that the certificate is not certifying that L-7 was qualified to be as a bidder or it had earned a right to have his bid accepted of the quoted tariff.He submits that if the quoted tariff of L-4 bidder of Rs.5.143 and L-5 bidder of Rs.5.300 were misaligned, then, most certainly, the quoted tariff of L-7 bidder of Rs.5.517 was also misaligned.The learned Senior Counsel submits that the under Section 63 of the Electricity Act is not that of a mere post office.The State Commission has a power to reject the adoption of tariff if it is not aligned to market prices.In this respect, he (2021) 4 SCC 7862020 INSC 497 refers to the judgments of this Court in the cases of Tata Power Company Limited v. Electricity Regulatory Commission Ors.4 and Energy Watchdog v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and others5.Shri submits that the State Commission while adopting the tariff is bound to take into consideration the protection of consumer interest.Reliance in this respect has been placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of GMR Warora Energy Limited v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) Ors.6, wherein this Court has emphasized the need for balancing the interest of the consumers with that of the generators.Shri further submits that in view of clauses 2.15.1 and 3.5.12 of the RFP and clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines, the appellants had the power to reject all price bids if the rates quoted are not aligned to the prevailing market prices.Shri lastly submitted that the bidders have no vested right to contract.Article 226 of the of SCC Online INSC 1220 (2017) 14 SCC 802017 INSC 338 2023 SCC Online SC 4642023 INSC 398 India cannot be used to award a contract in favour of the bidder.In this respect, he refers to the following judgments of this Court Tata v. Union of India7 ii.Housing Board and another v. G.S.Investments and another8 Laxmikant and others v. and others9 Shri submits that the impugned judgment and order is not sustainable and is liable to be set aside.OF THE RESPONDENTS Dr.A.M. Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel, per contra, submits that unlike Section 62 read with Sections 61 and 64 of the Electricity Act, under Section 63 of the Electricity Act, the Commission only adopts tariff and does not tariff.However, in cases under Section 63 of the Electricity Act, the Central Commission is bound by the guidelines issued by the Central Government and it is required (1994) 6 SCC 651 (para 94) 1994 INSC 283 (2007) 1 SCC 477 (para 8, 9 and 11) 2006 INSC 766 (1996) 4 SCC 2081996 INSC 409 to its regulatory functions, albeit under Section 79(1)(b) only in with those guidelines.In this respect, he relies on the judgment of this Court in the case of Energy Watchdog (supra) and Tata Power Company Limited (supra).Dr. Singhvi submits that two that can be considered in a case under Section 63 of the Electricity Act by the Commission are (1) as to whether the bidding process was transparent and (2) as to whether the bidding process was held in with the guidelines issued by the Central Government.He submits that once the tariff is an outcome of the bidding process and the bidding process is transparent and held in with the Bidding Guidelines, the Commission is mandated to adopt such tariff and it does not have a discretion to go into the question as to whether it is market aligned or not.Dr. Singhvi further submits that while adopting an already tariff by the bidding process as per Section 63 of the Electricity Act, the issue of market alignment of respondent No.1s bid does not and cannot arise for consideration in these proceedings.Without prejudice to the aforesaid Dr. Singhvi submits that it is not permissible for the State Commission to go into the question of market alignment.He submitted that the respondent No.1s quoted tariff was market aligned not only in the year 2013 but also today.Dr. Singhvi submits that in the recent tender for procurement of 160 MW electricity, conducted in pursuance to the permission granted by this Court, the lowest bid for 1st year tariff discovered and approved by the appellants is at Rs.5.30 per unit.It is submitted that there is a vast 1st year tariff and tariff.Dr. Singhvi submits that however, if this offer for supply in the first year of the bid is to be for 25 years, it would come to Rs.7.91 per unit, which is around 50 higher than the 1st year tariff of the said bidder itself.Dr. Singhvi submits that M s Deloitte is a common consultant insofar as the appellants and the Uttar Pradesh Power Limited (UPPCL for short).He submits that, in fact, BEC of UPPCL, in March 2013, accepted tariff up to Rs.5.849 per unit i.e., a tariff much higher than that of respondent No.1-MB Power.It is submitted that the bidding period in the present case as well as in the case of UPPCL is the same.It is submitted that, however, in 2018, the BEC mischievously and considered tariff only up to 2012 and compared bids of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, which were, in fact, discovered in 2015 and 2014 It is submitted that similarly, in the State of Tamil Nadu, for the same period, the equivalent tariff was by M s Deloitte at Rs.5.75 per unit for 25 years and the same was accepted.It is, submitted that, considering the aforesaid, the tariff of the respondent No.1-MB Power for 25 years at Rs.5.517 per unit is indisputably market aligned even as on Dr. Singhvi, relied on the following charts to show that the tariff for 25 years, as quoted by the respondent No.1- MB Power, is very much market aligned.Market Price as of 2012-13 at the time of Bid 1st Year PPA State Quoted Tariff for Duration Tariff

Dr. Singhvi, the learned Senior Counsel, relying on clause 3.5.9 of the RFP, submits that, no negotiations were permissible in spite of the specific clause in the RFP and the opinion to the contrary given by the consultant.It is submitted that the appellants tried to negotiate the prices with L-1 to L-3 bidders, which decision has been finally set aside by this Court vide order dated 25th April 2018.Dr. Singhvi submits that in view of the specific certificate dated 4th June 2013, issued by the BEC, certifying that the bidding procedure for the bids in question had been carried out by the appellants in conformity with the provisions of the RFP and the Bidding Guidelines issued by the Government of India, it is not permissible for the appellants to take a contradictory stand.Dr. Singhvi submits that what this Court had directed by order dated 25th April 2018, was to adopt the tariff with regard to L-4 and L-5 bidders.By the subsequent order dated 19th November 2018, this Court clarified and directed to decide the tariff under Section 63 of the Electricity Act having regard to the law laid down both and by this Court.It is submitted that the only scrutiny that could be done by the Commission was only with regard to the following of the twin as observed by this Court in the case of Energy Watchdog (supra).Dr. Singhvi submits that the power to reject the bids is in respect of all price bids.He submits that if it is found that the bidding process was not transparent and the Guidelines were not followed or the bids are not market aligned, then the appellants would be entitled to reject all bids and not and some bids.He submits that if the as placed by the appellants is to be accepted, it will vest an power with the of energy to reject the bid of any of the bidders.It is submitted that such an and unchecked discretion cannot be permitted to be by the appellants companies (DISCOMS).Dr. Singhvi submits that insofar as the aspect with regard to consumers interest is concerned, the learned APTEL has squarely covered the same.It has been held by the learned APTEL that the consumers interest is a broad term and among others, involves reliable, quality and un-interrupted power on long term basis besides being competitive.The learned Senior Counsel submits that the State of MW of power when it invited the bids in question.He submits that the DISCOMS have even fairly admitted that they are still in need of power and as such, filed an Interlocutory Application being I.A.No.150366 of 2023 in Civil Appeal No.4612 of 2023 (for permission to file additional documents) seeking permission to procure power for medium term from the State Commission.It is, submitted that even in the larger public interest and consumer interest, the appellants should procure the power from the respondent No.1- MB Power.Dr. Singhvi submits that the appellants are bound to procure 906 MW of power in view of the orders passed by this Court on 25th of April 2018.He submits that the RFP provides for bucket filling.It is, submitted that the appellants are required to procure the power going down the ladder from the bidders starting from L-1 to the one till procurement of 906 MW of power is complete.It is submitted that since many of the bidders had now gone into insolvency, it is only 3 bidders, which are left in the fray.L-1 bidder is supplying 195 MW power and L-2 is supplying 311 MW power.It is submitted that even in the event, this Court permits L-5 bidder to supply 100 MW power and 160 MW power for medium term in pursuance to the order passed by this Court on 26th 2023, still the total would not be beyond 766 MW.Still the balance of 140 MW power would remain.Dr. Singhvi submits insofar as of the appellants with regard to delay and laches is concerned, the same is without substance.He submits that only after the respondent No.1 came to know about the incapacity of L-3, L-4 and L-6 bidders to honour their offered capacity, the occasion to revalidate the claim of the respondent No.1 arose.The learned Senior Counsel, relying on clause 3.5.6 of the RFP, submits that the selection process shall continue till the capacity has been achieved through the summation of the quantum offered by the bidders or when the balance of the capacity is less than the bid capacity.It is submitted that since there is still a gap of 140 MW, to comply with this Courts order dated 25th April 2018, the appellants are bound to enter into PPAs with the qualified bidders until the entire capacity of 906 MW is met.Dr. Singhvi relied on the following chart to show that the prices discovered in all medium and long term bids are much higher than the price quoted by the respondent No.1- MB Power.Prices discovered in all medium and long term

will be in the interests of the consumers, who will be getting the electricity at lesser prices than what has recently been as a price in the bidding process.He submits that this is specifically so when indisputably even according to the appellants they are in dire need of power.Dr. Singhvi, prays for of the present appeals.Shri C.S.learned Senior Counsel also similar arguments and prayed for of the present appeals.CONSIDERATIONS For considering the rival it will be necessary to refer to some of the provisions of the Electricity Act, which are as under Determination of tariff by bidding

applicable pursuant to this RFP for supply of power by itself or through the Project Company as per the terms of the RFP Documents, and to whom a Letter of Intent has been issued The impugned judgment of the High Court is basically based on the judgment of the learned APTEL dated 3 rd February 2020 in the case of SKS Power and orders passed by this Court as already observed herein above.After the bids were for procurement of MW, the BEC to accept the bids of L-1, L-2 and L-3 bidders.However, as the State government had reduction of purchase to only 500 MW power, RVPN filed an application under Regulation 7 of the RERC Regulations 2004, for adoption of tariff of L-1 to L-3, so also allowing it to purchase only 500 MW of power as against MW.The said application was allowed by the State Commission.The State Commission also adopted the tariff through the bidding process for purchase of 500 MW power vide its order dated 22nd July 2015.The said order of the State Commission was challenged before the learned APTEL by M s D.B.Power Ltd L-2 bidder and by M s Lanco Power Ltd. L-3 bidder by way of Appeal Nos.235 of 2015 and 191 of 2015 The learned APTEL in the said appeals, vide judgment and order dated 2nd February 2018, set aside the order of the State Commission dated 22nd July,2015, and passed the following directions ORDER Hence, the Appeal Nos.235 of 2015 and 191 of 2015 are allowed and the State order dated is set aside.The State Commission is directed to pass consequential order in with the law keeping in view our observations made above as well as the judgments of this Tribunal earlier on the aspects of the scope of Section 63 of the Act as expeditiously as possible, preferably, within 2 months from today.No order as to costs.After the learned APTEL passed the aforesaid order, M s B.Power Ltd. (L-2 bidder) filed an Interlocutory Application before the State Commission, praying for passing forthwith consequential orders in terms of the judgment of the learned APTEL.It also sought a direction to DISCOMS to start procuring power from it to the extent of 410 MW as per the PPA dated 1 st November 2013.When the matter was heard by the State Commission on 8th March 2018, it was noticed that appeals against the order of the learned APTEL were pending before this Court.This Court disposed of the said appeals vide judgment and order dated 25th April 2018, and issued the following directions We are in with the earlier conclusion of the APTEL.We are of the view that the direction of reduction of capacity from mw to 500 mw by the State Commission was correctly set aside.Since L- 1 to L-5 were before this Court, we direct that they shall be entitled to supply of power in terms of the originally offered amount, mentioned above, in with para 3.5 of the Request for Proposal.The power supply will now be reduced to a total of 906 mw.The State Commission may now go into the issue of approval for adoption of tariff with regard to L-4 and L-5.All Letters of Intent (LOIs) shall stand modified in terms of the above.All the appeals shall stand disposed of in terms of the above order.Consequent to the orders passed by this Court, the State Commission vide its order dated 29th May 2018, directed RVPN DISCOMS to file an application petition in relation to L-3, L-4 and L-5 bidders.RVPN accordingly filed an application on 27th August 2018 before the State Commission, submitting therein that the tariff of L-4 and L-5 bidders was very high and not aligned to market prices and, sought not to be adopted in terms of the competitive bidding guidelines and documents.In the meantime, a Contempt Petition came to be filed before this Court by SKS Power.This Court vide order dated 20th 2018, in the said Contempt Petition, issued the following directions We are of the view that there is no doubt whatsoever that now the PPA has to be signed the parties.However, the State Commission, may, as per our order, go into the issue of approval of adoption of tariff with regard to L-5, who is the party before us, and will decide the same within a period of six weeks from today.PPA is to be signed immediately emphasis supplied SKS Power filed an Interlocutory Application on 5th October 2018, praying for adoption of its tariff as per the orders of this Court dated 25th April 2018 and 20th 2018.It was contended before the State Commission by SKS Power that the State Commission was bound to adopt tariff as quoted by it.However, per contra, it was contended by the RVPN and DISCOMS that since the tariff quoted by SKS Power was not market aligned, it could not be adopted.In view of the counter the State Commission vide its order dated 16th October 2018, gave an opportunity to the RVPN to file an amended application or seek direction on the issue from this Court.Accordingly, RVPN filed a Miscellaneous Application before this Court.This Court vide order dated 19th November 2018, passed the following order Having heard learned counsels for both the parties, we only clarify that the Electricity Regulatory Commission the State Commission) is to decide the tariff under- Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 having regard to the law laid down both and by this Court.The State Commission to finalise the aforesaid prices within a period of eight weeks from today.The MAs are disposed of accordingly.A review application was also filed on behalf of the SKS Power.The said review application was disposed of by this Court vide order dated 21st January 2019, with the following directions We find that as per the Standard Bidding Guidelines the PPA is first to be signed after which the question of adoption of tariff has to be taken up.With this of the order, we dispose of the review and the M.A.The State Commission which has its judgment on will hear the parties within a period of two weeks from today and will pass orders after taking into account the order that we have passed today.In with the directions issued by this Court, the State Commission considered the rival of the parties and came to a conclusion that the tariff quoted by SKS Power was not market aligned.The State Commission also found that, adoption of such high rate would be against the consumer interest.The State Commission, vide order dated 26th February 2019, not to adopt the tariff quoted by L-4 and L-5 bidders.The said order dated 26th February 2019 of the State Commission was challenged before the learned APTEL by SKS Power by way of Appeal No.224 of 2019.The learned APTEL framed the following three in the said appeal ISSUE NO.1 Whether the Respondent Commission could reject the tariff bid of the Appellant, in terms of Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and the directions issued by the Honble Supreme Court?ISSUE NO.2 Whether there was a sufficient proof to show that the bid of the Appellant was market aligned?ISSUE NO.3 Whether the argument of Consumer interest be advanced by the Discoms in the facts of the present Appeal?The learned APTEL while answering the first issue, came to the conclusion that the State Commission, while adopting tariff under Section 63, has to only consider that the Bidding Guidelines issued by the Central Government providing for tariff structure were complied with or not.The learned APTEL also held that the State Commission cannot its powers de hors such guidelines.It further held that the State Commission has no power to reject the tariff of a bidder.Insofar as the second issue is concerned, the learned APTEL came to a finding that, since the bid of SKS Power was already evaluated, and the subsequent certificates were issued by the BEC confirming the transparency of the bid, it was not open for the State Commission to go into the question, as to whether the tariff quoted by SKS Power was market aligned or not.It further held that, after the order dated 25th April 2018 was passed by this Court, it was not open for the State Commission to re- evaluate the bid.Insofar as the third issue with regard to consumers interest is concerned, the learned APTEL held that the said issue cannot be raised again at that stage when the same had been dealt with in detail by the learned APTEL vide order dated 2nd February 2018 and also considered by this Court before passing the order dated 25th April, 2018.Accordingly, the appeal was allowed by the learned APTEL vide order dated 3rd February 2020 and the order dated 26th February 2019 of the State Commission was set aside.The learned APTEL directed that the tariff of SKS Power, as offered in its bid, shall be adopted.The parties were directed to revive and implement the PPA dated 4th February 2019.This order dated 3rd February 2020, passed by the learned APTEL has been challenged by the DISCOMS and RVPN before this Court by way of Civil Appeal No.1937 of 2020 and Civil Appeal No.2721 of 2020 The respondent No.1 in the present proceedings rests its claim on the aforesaid orders passed by this Court and the order dated 3rd February 2020, passed by the learned APTEL.Basically, it is the of the respondent No.1-MB Power that after the orders were passed by this Court, RVPN and the DISCOMS were bound to procure electricity power from the bidders going down the ladder until the entire 906 MW power was exhausted.It is their that once it is certified that the bid evaluation process has been complied with as per the Bidding Guidelines issued by the Central Government, it is presumed that the process was transparent and it is not permissible for the State Commission to go into the question of market aligned tariff and also the consumer interest.It is their that without considering the question, as to whether the tariff was market aligned or not, the were bound to accept supply from the bidders at the rates quoted by them.It is their that the power under Section 63 of the Electricity Act restricted the scrutiny only to two aspects, viz., (1) whether the Bidding Guidelines framed by the Union of India under Section 63 of the Electricity Act were followed and (2) whether the bidding process was transparent or not.The High Court in the impugned judgment, relying on the observations of the learned APTEL and the earlier orders of this Court has come to a conclusion that, applying the test of filling the bucket, the were bound to take supply from the respondent No.1-MB Power at the rates quoted by it.On the basis of the judgment of the learned APTEL, the High Court held that the respondent No.1-MB Power had a right to supply power since there was a gap of 300 MW the power procured by the and the ceiling of 906 MW by this Court.In these premises, the High Court issued a mandamus directing the appellants to take supply of 200 MW electricity power from the respondent No.1-MB Power at the rates quoted by it.We, find that, before deciding the correctness or otherwise of the impugned judgment, it will be necessary for us to examine the correctness of the judgment and order dated 3rd February 2020, passed by the learned APTEL in the case of SKS Power.We have already reproduced Section 63 of the Electricity Act.The provisions of Section 63 of the Electricity Act fell for consideration before this Court in the case of Energy Watchdog (supra).It will be apposite to refer to 19 and 20 of the said judgment, which are as under The construction of Section 63, when read with the other provisions of this Act, is what comes up for decision in the present appeals.It may be noticed that Section 63 begins with a non obstante clause, but it is a non obstante clause covering only Section 62.Secondly, unlike Section 62 read with Sections 61 and 64, the Commission does not tariff but only adopts tariff already under Section 63.Thirdly, such adoption is only if such tariff has been through a transparent process of bidding, and, fourthly, this transparent process of bidding must be in with the guidelines issued by the Central Government.What has been argued before us is that Section 63 is a standalone provision and has to be construed on its own terms, and that, in the case of transparent bidding nothing can be looked at except the bid itself which must accord with guidelines issued by the Central Government.One thing is immediately clear, that the Commission does not act as a mere post office under Section 63.It must adopt the tariff which has been through a transparent process of bidding, but this can only be done in with the guidelines issued by the Central Government.Guidelines have been issued under this section on 19-1-2005, which guidelines have been amended from time to time.Clause 4, in particular, deals with tariff and the Commission certainly has the to look into whether the tariff through the process of bidding accords with Clause 4.It is important to note that the regulatory powers of the Central Commission, so far as tariff is concerned, are specifically mentioned in Section 79(1).This regulatory power is a general one, and it is very difficult to state that when the Commission adopts tariff under Section 63, it functions dehors its general regulatory power under Section 79(1)(b).For one thing, such regulation takes place under the Central Governments guidelines.For another, in a situation where there are no guidelines or in a situation which is not covered by the guidelines, can it be said that the power to regulate tariff is completely done away with?According to us, this is not a correct way of reading the aforesaid provisions.The first rule of is that the must be read as a whole.As a concomitant of that rule, it is also clear that all the discordant notes struck by the various sections must be harmonised.Considering the fact that the non obstante clause advisedly restricts itself to Section 62, we see no good reason to put Section 79 out of the way altogether.The reason why Section 62 alone has been put out of the way is that determination of tariff can take place in one of two ways either under Section 62, where the Commission itself the tariff in with the provisions of the Act (after laying down the terms and conditions for determination of tariff mentioned in Section 61) or under Section 63 where the Commission adopts tariff that is already by a transparent process of bidding.In either case, the general regulatory power of the Commission under Section 79(1)(b) is the source of the power to regulate, which includes the power to or adopt tariff.In fact, Sections 62 and 63 deal with determination of tariff, which is part of regulating tariff.Whereas determining tariff for of electricity is dealt with by Section 79(1)(d), Section 79(1)(b) is a wider source of power to regulate tariff.It is clear that in a situation where the guidelines issued by the Central Government under Section 63 cover the situation, the Central Commission is bound by those guidelines and must its regulatory functions, albeit under Section 79(1)(b), only in with those guidelines.As has been stated above, it is only in a situation where there are no guidelines framed at all or where the guidelines do not deal with a given situation that the general regulatory powers under Section 79(1)(b) can then be used.emphasis supplied It could thus be seen that it has been held by this Court that unlike Section 62 read with Sections 61 and 64, under the provisions of Section 63 of the Electricity Act, the Commission does not tariff but only adopts tariff already under Section 63.It has further been held that, such adoption is only if such tariff has been through a transparent process of bidding, and that, this transparent process of bidding must be in with the guidelines issued by the Central Government.It was sought to be contended before this Court in the said case that Section 63 is a standalone provision and has to be construed on its own terms, and that, in the case of transparent bidding nothing can be looked at except the bid itself which must accord with guidelines issued by the Central Government.However, rejecting the said this Court observed that the Commission does not act as a mere post office under Section 63.It has been observed that, Clause 4, in particular, deals with tariff and the Commission certainly has the to look into whether the tariff through the process of bidding accords with Clause 4.This Court in the said case, in 20, further observed that the entire Act shall be read as a whole.It has been held that, all the discordant notes struck by the various sections must be harmonized.It has been held that, considering the fact that the non obstante clause advisedly restricts itself to Section 62, there is no reason to put Section 79 out of the way altogether.It has been held that, either under Section 62, or under Section 63, the general regulatory power of the Commission under Section 79(1)(b) is the source of the power to regulate, which includes the power to or adopt tariff.It has been held that, Sections 62 and 63 deal with determination of tariff, which is part of regulating tariff.It has further been held that, in a situation where the guidelines issued by the Central Government under Section 63 cover the situation, the Central Commission is bound by those guidelines and must its regulatory functions, albeit under Section 79(1)(b), only in with those guidelines.It has further been held that, it is only in a situation where there are no guidelines framed at all or where the guidelines do not deal with a given situation that the general regulatory powers under Section 79(1)(b) can be used.The aforesaid view of this Court in the case of Energy Watchdog (supra), which is a judgment by two Judge Bench, has been approved by three Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Tata Power Company Limited (supra).We have already to Section 86(1)(b) of the Electricity Act, which is analogous to Section 79 of the Electricity Act.Section 79 the functions of Central Commission, whereas Section 86 provides for the functions of the State Commission.Section 86 of the Electricity Act empowers the State Commission to regulate electricity purchase and procurement process of including the price at which electricity shall be procured from the generating companies or or from other sources through for purchase of power for and supply within the State.It can thus be seen that Section 86(1)(b) of the Electricity Act gives ample power on the State Commission to regulate electricity purchase and procurement process of It also empowers the State Commission to regulate the matters including the price at which electricity shall be procured from the generating companies, etc.It will also be relevant to refer to the Bidding Guidelines notified by the Central Government vide Resolution dated 19th January 2005.The preamble of the Bidding Guidelines specifically states that, one of the objectives of the said Bidding Guidelines is to facilitate transparency and fairness in procurement and protection of consumer interests by competitive conditions in procurement of electricity.Clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines is an important clause.It provides that, the bidder who has quoted lowest tariff as per evaluation procedure, shall be considered for the award.It also provides that the evaluation committee shall have the right to reject all price bids if the rates quoted are not aligned to the prevailing market prices.It is thus amply clear that the evaluation committee is to consider, as to whether the rates quoted are aligned to the market price or not, and that the evaluation committee shall have the right to reject all the price bids if it finds that the rates quoted are not aligned to the prevailing market price.The orders which are relied upon by the learned APTEL, specifically the order dated 19th November 2018 of this Court, had specifically clarified that the State Commission was to decide the tariff under Section 63 of the Electricity Act having regard to the law laid down both and by this Court.In this background, the State Commission was justified in considering clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines, which specifically permits to reject all price bids if the rates quoted are not aligned to the prevailing market prices.The that this Court has ordered that the bids quoted by the bidders are to be accepted without going into the question of it being market aligned or not, in our view, is without substance.If the of the respondent No.1-MB Power that the is bound to accept all the bids in a competitive bidding process once the bidding process was found to be transparent and in compliance with the Bidding Guidelines is to be accepted, in our view, it will do complete violence to clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines itself.If that view is accepted, the DISCOMS will be compelled to purchase electricity at a much higher rate as compared with other suppliers.The said higher rate will be passed on to the consumers.As such, accepting the of the respondent No.1 would result in adversely affecting the interests of the consumers and, in turn, would be against the larger public interest.For example, if in a bidding process for MW power, 10 persons as qualified bidders.L-1 bidder quotes Rs.2 per unit for 100 MW power and L-2 bidder quotes Rs.2.25 per unit for another 100 MW power and from L-3 bidder onwards, they start quoting Rs.10 per unit and above for balance 800 MW power, could the public interest be subserved by compelling the to buy balance 800 MW power at Rs.10 per unit and above when the prices quoted are totally not aligned to market prices.We are, of the considered view that the learned APTEL has grossly erred in holding that the State Commission has no power to go into the question, as to whether the prices quoted are market aligned or not and also not to take into consideration the aspect of consumers interest.When the Bidding Guidelines itself permit the BEC to reject all price bids if the rates quoted are not aligned to the prevailing market prices, there is no question of the State Commission being not in a position to go into the question, as to whether the rates quoted are market aligned or not, specifically, in the light of ample powers vested with the State Commission under Section 86(1)(b) of the Electricity Act, which also includes the power to regulate the prices at which electricity shall be procured from the generating companies, etc.The finding of the learned APTEL, in our view, is totally erroneous.In the case of SKS Power, the BEC, consisting of following 6 members, has considered the tariff quoted by L-4 and L-5 bidders Shri R.K. Jain, Chief Engineer (NPP RA), RVPN, Jaipur Shri Manish Saxena, Chief Controller of Accounts, RVPN, Jaipur Shri M.M.Ranwa, Chief Engineer, RUVNL, Jaipur Shri K.L.Meena, Addl.Chief Engineer (Fuel), RVUN, Jaipur Shri S.K.Mathur, Chief Engineer (HQ), JVVNL, Jaipur and Shri Tarun Agarwal, CA, Partner M s Shyamlal Agrawal Co., Jaipur It can be seen that the said Committee consisted of 4 technical members of the rank of Chief Engineer Additional Chief Engineer.It consisted of the Chief Controller of Account, RVPN, Jaipur.It also consisted of a Chartered Accountant, who is an expert in financial matters.After due deliberations, the BEC consisting of experts found that the prices quoted by L-4 and L- 5 bidders were exorbitantly high and it would result in additional financial burden of more than Rs.1715 crore on the consumers of the State as compared to the tariff of L-1 bidder.The State Commission after considering the detailed analysis of the BEC had come to the considered conclusion that the prices offered by SKS Power (L-5 bidder) were not market aligned, and not in the consumers interest.We, find that the learned APTEL has grossly erred in reversing the order passed by the State Commission, which was, in turn, based on the decision of the BEC in with clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines.We further find that it cannot be read from the orders of this Court that the State Commission was bound to accept the bids as quoted by the bidders till the bucket was filled.Firstly, no such direction can be issued by this Court de hors the provisions of Section 63 and 86(1)(b) of the Electricity Act and the Bidding Guidelines.In any event, vide order dated 19th November 2018, this Court had specifically directed the State Commission to decide the tariff under Section 63 of the Electricity Act having regard to the law laid down both and by this Court.As such, the State Commission was bound to take into consideration the Bidding Guidelines and specifically clause 5.15 thereof.With regard to the that the power under clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines can be only when the bidding process is found to be not in compliance with the Bidding Guidelines and is not transparent in respect of all the bidders and not in respect of some of the bidders is concerned, in our view, the same is without substance.We may in this respect refer to Section 13(2) of the General Clauses Act, which reads thus Gender and number.In all Central Acts and Regulations, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context, (1) and (2) words in the singular shall include the plural, and vice versa.Apart from that, the Bench of this Court in the case of Vivek Sharma and others v. Union of India and others10 had an occasion to consider the question, as to whether the word any would include all and vice versa.The Bench of this Court observed thus It is strenuously urged by the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners that the word any used in sub- section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act will have to be given a restricted meaning to mean some.It is submitted that if sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act is not read in such manner, the very power under the said sub-section will have to be held to be invalid on the ground of delegation.It is submitted that it cannot be construed that the legislature intended to bestow uncanalised, unguided and power on the Central Government to the entire currency.It is, the of the petitioners that in order to save the said section from being declared void, the word any requires to be in a restricted manner to mean some.Per contra, it is submitted on behalf of the respondents that the word any under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act, cannot be in a narrow manner (2023) 3 SCC 12023 INSC 2 and it will have to be construed to include all.construing the word any A Bench of this Court in Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 AIR 1961 SC 838 was considering the question as to whether the phrase any one of the Directors as found in Section 76 of the Mines Act, 1952 could mean only one of the Directors or could it be construed to mean every one of the Directors.In the said case, all the Directors of the Company were prosecuted for the offences punishable under Sections 73 and 74 of the Mines Act, 1952.The High Court had held Lala Karam Chand Thapar v. State of Bihar, 1958 SCC OnLine Pat 30 that any one of the Directors of the Company could only be prosecuted.The Bench of this Court observed thus (Lala Karam Chand Thapar case Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 AIR 1961 SC 838 , AIR pp.847-48, paras 29-34) It is quite clear and indeed not disputed that in some contexts, any one means one only it matters not which one the phrase any of the Directors is quite capable of meaning only one of the Directors, it does not matter which one.Is the phrase however capable of no other meaning?If it is not, the courts cannot look further, and must interpret these words in that meaning only, of what the of the legislature might be to have been.If however the phrase is capable of another meaning, as suggested viz.every one of the Directors it will be necessary to decide which of the two meanings was intended by the legislature.If one examines the use of the words any one in common conversation or literature, there can be no doubt that they are not infrequently used to mean every one not one, but all.Thus we say of any one can see that this is wrong, to mean can see that this is wrong.Any one may enter does not mean that only one person may enter, but that all may enter.It is permissible and indeed profitable to turn in this to Oxford English Dictionary, at p. 378, of which, we find the meaning of any given thusIn affirmative it a being or thing of the sort named, without as to which, and thus of every one of them.One of the illustrations given is I challenge anyone to contradict my Certainly, this does not mean that one only is challenged but that all are challenged.It is abundantly clear that any one is not infrequently used to mean every one.But, argues Mr Pathak, granting that this is so, it must be held that when the phrase any one is used with the preposition of, followed by a word denoting a number of persons, it never means every one.The extract from Oxford Dictionary, it is interesting to notice, speaks of an assertion a being or thing of the sort named it is not unreasonable to say that, the word of followed by a word denoting a number of persons or things is just such naming of a sort as mentioned there.Suppose, the illustration I challenge any one to contradict my was changed to I challenge any one of my opponents to contradict my assertion.Any one of my opponents here would mean all my opponents not one only of the opponents.While the phrase any one of them or any similar phrase consisting of any one, followed by of which is followed in its turn by words denoting a number of persons or things, does not appear to have fallen for judicial construction, in our courts or in England the phrase any of the present Directors had to be in an old English case, Isle of Wight Railway Co. v. Tahourdin Isle of Wight Railway Co. v. Tahourdin, (1883) LR 25 Ch D 320 (CA) .A number of shareholders required the Directors to call a meeting of the company for two objects.One of the objects was mentioned as To remove, if necessary or any of the present Directors, and to elect Directors to fill any vacancy on the Board.The Directors issued a notice to convene a meeting for the other object and held the meeting.Then the shareholders, under the Companies Clauses Act,1845, issued a notice of their own a meeting for both the objects in the original In an action by the Directors to restrain the from holding the meeting, the Court of Appeal held that a notice to remove any of the present Directors would justify a resolution for removing all who are Directors at the present time.Any, Lord Cotton, L.J.pointed out, would involve all.It is true that the language there was any of the present Directors and not any one of the present Directors and it is urged that the word one, in the latter phrase makes all the We think it will be wrong to put too much emphasis on the word one here.It may be pointed out in this that the Permanent Edition of Words and Phrases, mentions an American case Front Building Loan Assn.v. Berzinski Front Building Loan Assn.v. Berzinski, 130 Pa Super 297 196 A 572 (Superior Court of 1938) where the words any of them were held to be the equivalent of any one of them.After giving the matter full and anxious consideration, we have come to the conclusion that the words any one of the Directors is ambiguous in some contexts, it means only one of the Directors, does not matter which one, but in other contexts, it is capable of meaning every one of the Directors.Which of these two meanings was intended by the legislature in any particular phrase has to be by the courts on a consideration of the context in which the words appear, and in particular, the scheme and object of the legislation.(emphasis supplied) The Bench in Lala Karam Chand Thapar case Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 AIR 1961 SC 838 found that the words any one have been commonly used to mean every one i.e.not one, but all.It found that the word any, in affirmative a being or thing of the sort named, without It held that it is abundantly clear that the words any one are not infrequently used to mean every one.It could be seen that the Bench in Lala Karam Chand Thapar case Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 AIR 1961 SC 838 , after giving the matter full and anxious consideration, came to the conclusion that the words any one of the Directors was an ambiguous one.It held that in some contexts, it means only one of the Directors, does not matter which one, but in other contexts, it is capable of meaning every one of the Directors.It held that which of these two meanings was intended by the legislature in any particular phrase has to be by the courts on consideration of the context in which the words appear, and in particular, the scheme and object of the legislation.After examining the scheme of the Mines Act,1952, the Bench of this Court further observed thus (Lala Karam Chand Thapar case Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 AIR 1961 SC 838 , AIR pp.848-49, paras 36-38) But, argues Mr Pathak, one must not forget the special rule of for penal that if the language is ambiguous, the in favour of the accused should ordinarily be adopted.If you interpret any one in the sense suggested by him, the legislation he is void and so the accused escapes.One of the two possible constructions, thus being in favour of the accused, should be adopted.In our opinion, there is no substance in this The rule of strict of penal in favour of the accused is not of universal application, and must be considered along with other well- established rules of We have already seen that the scheme and object of the makes it reasonable to think that the legislature intended to subject all the Directors of a company owning coal mines to prosecution and penalties, and not one only of the Directors.In the face of these considerations there is no scope here of the application of the rule for strict of penal in favour of the accused.The High Court appears to have been greatly impressed by the fact that in other where the legislature wanted to make every one out of a group or a class of persons liable it used clear language expressing the and that the phrase any one has not been used in any other in this country to express every one.It will be unreasonable, in our opinion, to attach too much weight to this and as for the reasons mentioned above, we think the phrase any one of the Directors is capable of meaning every one of the Directors, the fact that in other different words were used to express a similar meaning is not of any We have, on all these considerations come to the conclusion that the words any one of the Directors has been used in Section 76 to mean every one of the Directors, and that the contrary given by the High Court is not correct.(emphasis supplied) It could thus be seen that though it was sought to be argued before the Court that since the rule of strict of penal in favour of the accused has to be adopted and that the word any was suffixed by the word one, it has to be given restricted meaning the Court in Lala Karam Chand Thapar case Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 AIR 1961 SC 838 came to the conclusion that the words any one of the Directors used in Section 76 of the Mines Act, 1952 would mean every one of the Directors.It is further to be noted that the word any in the said case was suffixed by the word one, still the Court held that the words any one would mean all and not one.It is to be noted that in the present case, the legislature has not employed the word one after the word any.It is settled law that it has to be construed that every single word employed or not employed by the legislature has a purpose behind it.On the very date on which the judgment in Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 AIR 1961 SC 838 was pronounced, the same Bench also pronounced the judgment in v. State of Bihar, (1962) 1 SCR 33 AIR 1961 SC 849 , wherein the Bench observed thus case v. State of Bihar, (1962) 1 SCR 33 AIR 1961 SC 849 , AIR p. 850, para 3) The first is based on an assumption that the word any one in Section 76 means only one of the Directors, and only one of the shareholders.This question as regards the of the word any one in Section 76 was raised in Criminal Appeals Nos.98 to 106 of 1959 (Chief Inspector of Mines Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 AIR 1961 SC 838 , etc.)and it has been there that the word any one should be there as every one.Thus under Section 76 every one of the shareholders of a private company owning the mine, and every one of the Directors of a public company owning the mine is liable to prosecution.No question of violation of Article 14 arises.(emphasis supplied) Another Bench of this Court in Tej Kiran Jain Tej Kiran Jain v. N. Sanjiva Reddy, (1970) 2 SCC 272 was considering the provisions of Article 105 of the of India and, particularly, the immunity as to the Member of Parliament in respect of anything said in Parliament.The Bench observed thus (SCC p. 274, para 8) In our judgment it is not possible to read the provisions of the article in the way suggested.The article means what it says in language which could not be plainer.The article confers immunity inter alia in respect of anything said in Parliament.The word anything is of the widest import and is equivalent to everything.The only arises from the words in Parliament which means during the sitting of Parliament and in the course of the of Parliament.We are concerned only with in Lok Sabha.Once it was proved that Parliament was sitting and its was being transacted, anything said during the course of that was immune from proceedings in any Court this immunity is not only complete but is as it should be.It is of the of system of Government that peoples should be free to express without fear of legal What they say is only subject to the of the rules of Parliament, the good sense of the members and the control of proceedings by the Speaker.The Courts have no say in the matter and should really have none.(emphasis supplied) This Court held in Tej Kiran Jain case Tej Kiran Jain v. N. Sanjiva Reddy, (1970) 2 SCC 272 that the word anything is of the widest import and is equivalent to everything.The only arises from the words in Parliament which means during the sitting of Parliament and in the course of the of Parliament.It held that, once it was proved that Parliament was sitting and its was being transacted, anything said during the course of that was immune from proceedings in any court.This Court, in LDA LDA v. M.K.Gupta, (1994) 1 SCC 243 , was considering clause (o) of Section 2(1) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 which defines service, wherein the word any again fell for consideration.This Court observed thus (SCC p. 255, para 4) The words any and potential are Both are of wide amplitude.The word any means one or some or all.In Blacks Law Dictionary it is explained thus, word any has a diversity of meaning and may be employed to indicate all or every as well as some or one and its meaning in a given depends upon the context and the subject- matter of the The use of the word any in the context it has been used in clause (o) indicates that it has been used in wider sense extending from one to all.This Court held in LDA case LDA v. M.K.Gupta, (1994) 1 SCC 243 that the word any is of wide amplitude.It means one or some or all.Referring to Blacks Law Dictionary, the Court observed that the word any has a diversity of meaning and may be employed to indicate all or every as well as some or one.However, the meaning which is to be given to it would depend upon the context and the subject- matter of the In K.P.Mohammed Salim K.P.Mohammed Salim v. CIT, (2008) 11 SCC 573 , this Court was considering the power of the Director General or Chief Commissioner or Commissioner to transfer any case from one or more officers subordinate to him to any other officer or officers.This Court observed thus (SCC p. 578, para 17) The word any must be read in the context of the and for the said purpose, it may in a situation of this nature, means all.The principles of purposive construction for the said purpose may be resorted to.(See New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadia New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadia, (2008) 3 SCC 279 (2008) 1 SCC (Civ) 850 .)Thus, in the context of a the word any may be read as all in the context of the Income Tax Act for which the power of transfer has been conferred upon the authorities specified under Section 127.(emphasis supplied) The Court in K.P.Mohammed Salim K.P.Mohammed Salim v. CIT, (2008) 11 SCC 573 again that the word any must be read in the context of the The Court also applied the principles of purposive construction to the term any to mean all.In Raj Kumar Shivhare Raj Kumar Shivhare v. Directorate of Enforcement, (2010) 4 SCC 772 (2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 712 , an argument was sought to be advanced that since Section 35 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, uses the words any decision or order, only appeals from final order could be filed.Rejecting the said this Court observed thus (SCC pp.779-80, paras 19-20 26) The word any in this context would mean all.We are of this opinion in view of the fact that this section confers a right of appeal on any person aggrieved.A right of appeal, it is well settled, is a creature of It is never an inherent right, like that of filing a suit.A right of filing a suit, unless it is barred by as it is barred here under Section 34 of FEMA, is an inherent right (see Section 9 of the Civil Procedure Code) but a right of appeal is always conferred by a While conferring such right a may impose restrictions, like or pre- deposit of penalty or it may limit the area of appeal to questions of law or sometime to substantial questions of law.such are imposed, they are to be strictly followed.But in a case where there is no on the nature of order or decision to be appealed against, as in this case, the right of appeal cannot be further curtailed by this Court on the basis of an Under Section 35 of FEMA, the legislature has conferred a right of appeal to a person aggrieved from any order or decision of the Appellate Tribunal.Of course such appeal will have to be on a question of law.In this context the word any would mean all.In the instant case also when a right is conferred on a person aggrieved to file appeal from any order or decision of the Tribunal, there is no reason, in the absence of a contrary intent, to give it a restricted meaning.in our judgment in Section 35 of FEMA, any order or decision of the Appellate Tribunal would mean all decisions or orders of the Appellate Tribunal and all such decisions or orders are, subject to to the High Court on a question of law.(emphasis supplied) While holding that the word any in the context would mean all, this Court in Raj Kumar Shivhare Raj Kumar Shivhare v. Directorate of Enforcement, (2010) 4 SCC 772 (2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 712 observed that a right of appeal is always conferred by a It has been held that, while conferring such right, a may impose restrictions, like or pre-deposit of penalty or it may limit the area of appeal to questions of law or sometime to substantial questions of law.It has been held that such are imposed, they are to be strictly followed.It has been held that in a case where there is no the right of appeal cannot be curtailed by this Court on the basis of an Shri P. learned Senior Counsel relied on the judgment of this Court in Union of India v. A.B.Shah Union of India v. A.B.Shah, (1996) 8 SCC 540 1996 SCC (Cri) 688 .In the said case, the High Court was considering an appeal by the Union of India wherein it had challenged the acquittal of the accused by the learned trial court, which was confirmed in appeal by the High Court.The learned trial court and the High Court had held that the complaint filed was beyond This Court the judgments of the learned trial court and the High Court.This Court while interpreting the expression at any time observed thus (A.B.Shah case Union of India v. A.B.Shah, (1996) 8 SCC 540 1996 SCC (Cri) 688 , SCC p. 546, para 12) If we look into Conditions 3 and 6 with the object and purpose of the Act in mind, it has to be held that these conditions are not only relatable to what was required at the of depillaring process, but the unstowing for the required length must exist always.The expression at any time finding place in Condition 6 has to mean, in the context in which it has been used, at any point of time, the effect of which is that the required length must be maintained all the time.The accomplishment of object of the Act, one of which is safety in the mines, requires taking of such a view, especially in the backdrop of mine which have been taking, off and on, heavy toll of lives of the miners.It may be pointed out that the word any has a diversity of meaning and in Blacks Law Dictionary it has been stated that this word may be employed to indicate all or every, and its meaning will depend upon the context and of the A to what has been stated in Strouds Judicial Dictionary, Vol.I, is revealing inasmuch as the import of the word any has been explained from pp.145 to 153 of the 4th Edn., a perusal of which shows it has different depending primarily on the of the and the context of its use.A Bench of this Court in LDA v. M.K.Gupta LDA v. M.K.Gupta, (1994) 1 SCC 243 , gave a very wide meaning to this word finding place in Section 2(1)(o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 defining service.(See para 4) (emphasis supplied) Shri rightly argued that the word any will have to be construed in its context, taking into consideration the scheme and the purpose of the enactment.There can be no quarrel with regard to the said Right from the judgment of the Bench of this Court in Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar Chief Inspector of Mines v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, (1962) 1 SCR 9 AIR 1961 SC 838 , the position is clear.What is the meaning which the legislature intended to give to a particular provision has to be by the Court on a consideration of the context in which the word(s) appear(s) and in particular, the scheme and object of the legislation.From the perusal of the various judgments, which have been to in detail by the Bench, it will be clear that the words all or any will have to be construed in their context taking into consideration the scheme and purpose of the enactment.What is the meaning which the legislature intended to give to a particular provision has to be by the Court on a consideration of the context in which the word(s) appear(s) and in particular, the scheme and object of the legislation.We have no hesitation to hold that the word all used in clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines, read with the legislative policy for which the Electricity Act was enacted and read with Section 86(1)(b) of the Electricity Act, will have to be construed to be the one including any.As such, the in that regard is to be In any case, applying the principle of literal the evaluation committee BEC would be entitled to reject only such of the price bids if it finds that the rates quoted by the bidders are not aligned to the prevailing market prices.It does not stipulate rejection of all the bids in the bidding process.For example, if in a bidding process, which is in with the Bidding Guidelines and is transparent, 5 bidders Out of the said bidders, the rates quoted by only 3 bidders are market aligned and the rates quoted by rest of the 2 bidders are not market aligned.In with the Bidding Guidelines, the BEC would be entitled to recommend of the bids of the first 3 bidders and reject the bids of rest of the 2 bidders whose quoted rates prices are not found to be market aligned.We, reject the in this behalf.We further find that the Court, while interpreting a particular provision, will have to apply the principles of purposive construction.The Bench of this Court in the case of Vivek Sharma (supra) after surveying various judgments on the issue has held thus It is thus clear that it is a settled principle that the modern approach of is a pragmatic one, and not pedantic.An which advances the purpose of the Act and which ensures its smooth and harmonious working must be chosen and the other which leads to absurdity, or confusion, or friction, or contradiction and conflict its various provisions, or undermines, or tends to defeat or destroy the basic scheme and purpose of the enactment must be The primary and foremost task of the Court in interpreting a is to gather the of the legislature, actual or imputed.Having ascertained the it is the duty of the Court to strive to so interpret the as to promote or advance the object and purpose of the enactment.For this purpose, where necessary, the Court may even depart from the rule that plain words should be according to their plain meaning.There need be no meek and mute to the plainness of the language.To avoid patent injustice, anomaly or absurdity or to avoid of a law, the court would be justified in departing from the so-called golden rule of construction so as to give effect to the object and purpose of the enactment.Ascertainment of legislative intent is the basic rule of construction.It could thus be seen that it is a settled principle that the modern approach of is a pragmatic one, and not pedantic.An which advances the purpose of the Act and which ensures its smooth and harmonious working must be chosen and the other which leads to absurdity, or confusion, or friction, or contradiction and conflict its various provisions, or undermines, or tends to defeat or destroy the basic scheme and purpose of the enactment must be If the that clause 5.15 of the Bidding Guidelines will come into play, which permits the Evaluation Committee to reject all price bids and not any one of them is accepted, it will lead to nothing else than resulting in absurdity.Suppose, if L-1 bidder quotes Rs.3 per unit and L-5 bidder quotes Rs.7 per unit, to reject the bid of L-1 bidder, whose bid is found market aligned along with that of L-5 bidder, which is not market aligned, would lead to an anomalous situation.Could the consumer be deprived of the electricity to be procured from L-1 at a market aligned price only because some of the bidders have quoted much higher prices and are not market aligned.In our view, such an would result in defeating one of the main objects of the enactment, i.e., protection of the consumer.It is to state that this Court, time and again, in various judgments including the one in the case of GMR Warora Energy Limited (supra) has recognised the of balancing the consumers interest with that of the interest of the generators.It will not be permissible to take a lopsided view only to protect the interest of the generators ignoring the consumers interest and public interest.We find that the High Court was not justified in the petition.The Bench of this Court in the case of PTC India Limited (supra) has held that the Electricity Act is an exhaustive code on all matters electricity.Under the Electricity Act, all dealing with electricity have to be considered by the authorities under the said Act.As held by the Bench of this Court, the State Electricity Commission and the learned APTEL have ample powers to adjudicate in the matters with regard to electricity.Not only that, these Tribunals are tribunals consisting of experts having vast in the field of electricity.As such, we find that the High Court erred in directly the writ petition when the respondent No.1, i.e., the writ petitioner before the High Court had an adequate alternate remedy of approaching the State Electricity Commission.This Court in the case of Reliance Limited State of and others11 has held that while exercising its power of judicial review, the Court can step in where a case of manifest or is made out.In the present case, there is not even an allegation with regard to that effect.In such recourse to a petition under Article 226 of the of India in the of efficacious alternate remedy under a which is a complete code in itself, in our view, was not justified.No doubt that of an alternate remedy is not a complete bar in the of the power of judicial review by the High Courts.But, recourse to such a remedy would be permissible only if and exceptional are made out.A in this respect could be made to the judgments of this Court in the cases of Radha Krishan (2019) 3 SCC 3522019 INSC 63 Industries v. State of Himachal Pradesh and others12 and South Indian Bank Ltd. and others v. Naveen Mathew Philip and another13.We may gainfully refer to the observation of this Court in the case of Radha Krishan Industries (supra), wherein this Court has laid down certain principles after to the earlier judgments The High Court has dealt with the of the petition under Article 226 of the Relying on the decision of this Court in CCT v. Glaxo Smith Kline Consumer Health Care Ltd. CCT v. Glaxo Smith Kline Consumer Health Care Ltd., (2020) 19 SCC 681 2020 SCC OnLine SC 440 , the High Court noted that although it can entertain a petition under Article 226 of the it must not do so when the aggrieved person has an alternate remedy in law.However, certain exceptions to this rule of alternate remedy include where, the authority has not acted in with the provisions of the law or acted in defiance of the fundamental principles of judicial procedure or has resorted to invoke provisions, which are or where an order has been passed in violation of the (2021) 6 SCC 7712021 INSC 266 2023 SCC OnLine SC 435 2023 INSC 379 principles of natural justice.Applying this formulation, the High Court noted that the appellant has an alternate remedy under the GST Act and thus, the petition was not In this background, it becomes necessary for this Court, to dwell on the rule of alternate remedy and its judicial exposition.In Whirlpool Corpn.v. Registrar of Trade Marks Whirlpool Corpn.v. Registrar of Trade Marks, (1998) 8 SCC 1 , a two-Judge Bench of this Court after reviewing the case law on this point, noted (SCC pp.9-10, paras 14- 15) The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the is plenary in nature and is not limited by any other provision of the This power can be by the High Court not only for issuing writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, quo warranto and for the of any of the Fundamental Rights contained in Part of the but also for any other purpose.Under Article 226 of the the High Court, having regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition.But the High Court has imposed upon itself certain restrictions one of which is that if an and efficacious remedy is the High Court would not normally its But the alternative remedy has been consistently held by this Court not to operate as a bar in at least three namely, where the writ petition has been filed for the of any of the Fundamental Rights or where there has been a violation of the principle of natural justice or where the order or proceedings are wholly without or the vires of an Act is challenged.There is a plethora of case-law on this point but to cut down this circle of forensic whirlpool, we would rely on some old decisions of the evolutionary era of the law as they still hold the field.(emphasis supplied) Following the dictum of this Court in Whirlpool Whirlpool Corpn.v. Registrar of Trade Marks, (1998) 8 SCC 1 , in Sahnia v. Indian Oil Corpn.Ltd. Sahnia v. Indian Oil Corpn.Ltd., (2003) 2 SCC 107 , this Court noted that Sahnia case Sahnia v. Indian Oil Corpn.Ltd., (2003) 2 SCC 107 , SCC p. 110, para 7) So far as the view taken by the High Court that the remedy by way of recourse to arbitration clause was to the appellants and the writ petition filed by the appellants was liable to be is concerned, suffice it to observe that the rule of exclusion of writ by of an alternative remedy is a rule of discretion and not one of compulsion.In an case, in spite of of the alternative remedy, the High Court may still its writ in at least three (i) where the writ petition seeks of any of the fundamental rights (ii) where there is failure of principles of natural justice or where the orders or proceedings are wholly without or the vires of an Act is challenged.(See Whirlpool Corpn.v.Registrar of Trade Marks Whirlpool Corpn.v. Registrar of Trade Marks, (1998) 8 SCC 1 .)The present case of the first two Moreover, as noted, the appellants dealership, which is their bread and butter, came to be terminated for an irrelevant and cause.In such we feel that the appellants should have been allowed relief by the High Court itself instead of driving them to the need of arbitration proceedings.(emphasis supplied) The principles of law which are that 27.1.The power under Article 226 of the to issue writs can be not only for the of fundamental rights, but for any other purpose as well.27.2.The High Court has the discretion not to entertain a writ petition.One of the restrictions placed on the power of the High Court is where an alternate remedy is to the aggrieved person.27.3.Exceptions to the rule of alternate remedy arise where (a) the writ petition has been filed for the of a fundamental right protected by Part of the (b) there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice (c) the order or proceedings are wholly without or (d) the vires of a legislation is challenged.27.4.An alternate remedy by itself does not divest the High Court of its powers under Article 226 of the in an case though ordinarily, a writ petition should not be when an efficacious alternate remedy is provided by law.27.5.When a right is created by a which itself prescribes the remedy or procedure for enforcing the right or resort must be had to that particular remedy before invoking the discretionary remedy under Article 226 of the This rule of exhaustion of is a rule of policy, and discretion.27.6.In cases where there are disputed questions of fact, the High Court may decide to decline in a writ petition.However, if the High Court is objectively of the view that the nature of the controversy requires the of its writ such a view would not readily be with.These principles have been consistently upheld by this Court in Chand Ratan v. Durga Prasad Chand Ratan v. Durga Prasad, (2003) 5 SCC 399 , Babubhai Muljibhai Patel v. Nandlal Khodidas Barot Babubhai Muljibhai Patel v. Nandlal Khodidas Barot, (1974) 2 SCC 706 and SEB v. Union of India SEB v. Union of India, (2008) 5 SCC 632 among other decisions.This Court has clearly held that when a right is created by a which itself prescribes the remedy or procedure for enforcing the right or resort must be had to that particular remedy before invoking the discretionary remedy under Article 226 of the of India.Recently, this Court in the case of M s South Indian Bank Ltd. Ors.(supra) has also taken a similar view.There is another ground on which the High Court ought to have refused to entertain the petition.The bid of L-7 bidder was returned and the Bid Bond bank guarantee was also directed not to be vide the communication dated 6th January 2015.The judgment and order passed by this Court, on which reliance is placed by respondent No.1, is also on 25th April 2018.However, the respondent No.1 did not take any steps from 6 th January 2015 and in any case, from 25th April 2018 till 14th 2020, on which date the petition came to be filed before the High Court.No doubt that the petition need not be solely on the ground of delay and laches.However, if petitioner approaches the Court with delay, he has to satisfy the Court about the for delay in approaching the Court belatedly.In our considered view, the High Court ought not to have the petition also on the ground of delay and laches.In any case, we find that the High Court was not justified in issuing the mandamus in the nature which it has issued.This Court in the case of Air India Ltd. v. Cochin Airport Ltd. and others14 has observed thus The law relating to award of a contract by the State, its and bodies acting as and agencies of the Government has been settled by the decision of this Court in Shetty v.

Supreme_Court_2023_588,"V. J.Leave granted.The present appeal arises from the final judgment and order dated 24.01.2018 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short the National Commission), New Delhi in Revision Petition No.3415 of 2016.By the said Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by judgment, the National Commission the concurrent Jayant Kumar Arora Date 2023.07.31 IST judgments of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum Reason (for short the District Forum) and the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short the State Commission).The Fora below, while allowing the original complaint had directed the New India Assurance Company Limited (for short the Insurance Company) to indemnify the Claimant on basis to the extent of 75 of the sum assured, which was Facts The brief facts, necessary for adjudication of this Appeal, are as follows- The appellant was the owner of the truck (dumper) to as the vehicle) bearing Registration No.and had a valid insurance policy (Policy No.for the Insured Declared Value of for the period to On the appellants driver Mam Chand had to unload stone dust at Mittals Farm at Shankar ki Dhani.He parked the vehicle to find out the address.The admitted case is that he left the key in the key hole when he got out of the vehicle to look around for the address.In the letter of repudiation which to the of the driver Mam Chand, it was mentioned that Mam Chand alighted from the vehicle and went to enquire about Mittals Farm, after leaving the key of the said vehicle inside the key hole.When he had gone some distance, he heard the sound of starting of the vehicle and he came back and noticed that two persons were sitting on the drivers seat of the vehicle and a car was at the back of the said vehicle in which three persons were there.He had further stated that they stole and took away the vehicle.On itself, the appellant an FIR No.77 at the Bilaspur Police Station, Gurgaon under Section 379 of the IPC.On the Appellant intimated the respondent- Insurance Company about the theft.On the appellant filed a complaint CPA No.515 of 2009 before the District Forum, Gurgaon alleging that the respondent was delaying the of the claim and, as such, committed deficiency in service.Para 4 of the said complaint and the prayers made are important, which are set out herein below That the complainant had already been submitted all the relevant papers forms with the opposite party, but malafidely and without any right, title and interest, lingering the matter on one pretext to the another while the complainant has hired the services of the Opp.party by paying consideration of the premium for insured amount of and the Opp.party has totally failed to render sufficient services to the complainant.Direct the opposite party to pay the insured amount of the theft vehicle i.e Rs.along with interest 18 per annum from the date of theft till realization.Direct the opposite party to pay, a sum of on account of mental agony, delay, the harassment etc.suffered by the complainant.What is is that on the date of the complaint, the Insurance Company had not repudiated the claim.It appears from the record that the Insurance Company had appointed an agency named Delta to investigate the matter and the said agency, on had repudiation of the claim.After the complaint CPA No.515 of 2009 was lodged on it was only on that the respondent- Insurance Company issued a letter repudiating the claim.The relevant portion of the repudiation letter reads as follows- You, vide an letter dt.informed, for the first time, that your above said Dumper No.had been stolen on That, thus, from the above facts as disclosed by you and your driver, it is quite clear that the theft of your Dumper No.HR-55C- 5385 was totally the result of your and your driver Mam Chands total in not safeguarding the said vehicle properly.It is quite clear that had the said Dumper would not have been left un-attended and further the key of the said Dumper would not have been left inside the key hole of the said Dumper, then, the same could not have been taken away by any person.In view of above and violations of the terms and conditions of the subject insurance policy, the Co. is not liable to pay any claim in respect of the said Dumper.the competent authority of the Co. has repudiated your claim.It may please be noted.When the matter stood thus, the complaint CPA No.515 of 2009 came up before the District Forum on when the following appears to have been recorded of the advocate for the appellant, in CPA No.515 of 2009 I, Surender Kumar Gulia, Advocate, state that I do not want to proceed with my case.It may be Sd - Sd - Surender Kumar Gulia, Adv.Member RO AC DCDRF, GGN Recording the separately, the District Forum on disposed of the said complaint in the following terms- of the learned counsel for the complainant for withdrawal of the complaint recorded, separately.In view of the the complaint of the complainant is hereby as withdrawn.File be consigned to record room after due compliance.Faced with the repudiation, which is dated the Claimant, to indemnify himself and get the fruits of his insurance policy, filed a fresh complaint being C.C.No.134 of 2012.In the said complaint, the appellant averred that, after filing the earlier complaint, since the counsel for the opposite party viz., the Insurance Company took numerous dates for arguments on one pretext or the other, his counsel got annoyed with the of the said Advocate and, by mistake, withdrew the case on It was expressly pleaded that the withdrawal of the said complaint was unfortunate, and that the appellant should not be made to suffer for the wrong deeds of the counsel.In the complaint, the appellant prayed for a direction to the Insurance Company to pay the insured an amount of with interest 18 p.a.and further prayed for an amount of on account of mental agony, delay and harassment.The Insurance Company, in its reply, objected to the of the present complaint in view of the earlier proceedings in CPA No.515 of 2009.It also contended that the terms and conditions of the insurance policy were violated.Apart from this, the plea of was also taken.The objections were overruled by the District Forum.The plea of the complaint, being barred by was by recording a finding that the delay, if any, was already condoned, by the Forum, by order dated under Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act.The plea about violation of the conditions of the policy was overruled and on basis, a sum to the extent of 75 of the sum assured was awarded.No finding was recorded on the aspect of the bar in filing the present complaint after the order dated CPA No.515 of 2009 as withdrawn.The Insurance Company carried the matter in Appeal to the State Commission.Before the State Commission, only two were urged.There was no raised on the issue of the withdrawal of the earlier complaint.It was contended that the of the theft was given to the Insurance Company only on i.e., six days after the theft, it was argued that Condition No.1 of the insurance policy was violated.Apart from this, violation of Condition Nos.5 of the policy was also argued.Their point about the delay of six days in was brushed aside by to the Circular Ref IRDA HLTH/ MISC CIR 216/ 09/ 2011 dated 20th, 2011 issued by Insurance Regulatory Authority (for short IRDA), which stated that even if there was a condition in the policy regarding delay in the insurer cannot take its shelter to repudiate the claim, which is otherwise proved to be genuine.To appreciate the State finding with regard to violations of the conditions of the policy, it is necessary to extract Condition Nos.1 and 5 of the policy, which reads as follows Notice shall be given in writing to the Company immediately upon the of any accidental loss or damage and in the event of any claim and the insured shall give all such information and as the Company shall require.Every letter claim writ summons and or process or copy thereof shall be forwarded to the Company immediately on receipt by the insured.Notice shall also be given in writing to the Company immediately the insured shall have knowledge of any impending prosecution inquest or Fatal Inquiry in respect of any which may give rise to a claim under this policy, in case of theft or criminal act which may be the subject of a claim under this Policy the insured shall give immediate notice to the police and co-operate with the Company, in securing the conviction of the offender.The Insured shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard the vehicle insured from loss or damage and to maintain it in efficient condition and the Company shall have at all times free and full access to examine the vehicle insured or any part thereof or any driver or of the insured.In the event of any accident or breakdown, the vehicle insured shall not be left unattended without proper precautions being taken to prevent further damage or loss and if the vehicle insured be driven before the necessary repairs are any extension of the damage or any further damage to the vehicle shall be entirely at the insureds own risk.The State Commission clearly recorded that, soon after the theft of the vehicle on the FIR was lodged on with the Police and the Insurance Company was informed.It was also recorded that no cogent was produced by the Insurance Company to prove that there was a delay of six days in giving Going further, the State Commission recorded that Condition No.1 of the Insurance policy applied only to of an accident and not to theft cases.Insofar as Condition No.5 was concerned, it was held relying on the judgments of this Court in National Insurance Company Limited vs. Nitin Khandelwal, (2008) 11 SCC 259 and Amalendu Sahoo vs. Oriental Insurance Company Limited, (2010) 4 SCC 536 that even if there was a breach of that clause, the claim could not have been repudiated in toto and, applying the yardstick in Amalendu Sahoo (supra), 75 of the claim as the admissible amount, on basis, was awarded.Holding thus, the State Commission the Appeal of the Insurance Company.Undaunted, the Insurance Company carried the matter in revision to the National Commission.Here, it was primarily argued that the withdrawal of Complaint No.515 of 2009 foreclosed the Complainant from filing a fresh complaint.This plea was accepted relying on the bar under Order Rule (1) (4) of the Code of Civil Procedure 1(CPC).Further, dealing with the merits about the breach of Condition No.5, the National Commission found that Condition No.5 was breached because the vehicle was unattended on the road side with keys in the key hole.However, there was no further on the applicable law with regard to the of the breach and there is no whisper in the order of the National Commission about the in the orders of the fora below.Equally so, with regard to the argument on the breach of Condition No.1, it was recorded that there was an obligation of the claimant to give in writing of the theft of the vehicle.The National Commission, thus, allowed the Revision Petition.1 Withdrawal of suit or of part of claim.- (1) At any time after the of a suit, the plaintiff may as against all or any of the defendants abandon his suit or abandon a part of his claim Provided that where the plaintiff is a minor or other person to whom the provisions contained in Rules 1 to 14 of Order extend, neither the suit nor any part of the claim shall be abandoned without the leave of the Court.Where the plaintiff- (a) abandons any suit or part of claim under sub-rule(1), or (b) withdraws from a suit or part of a claim without the permission to in sub- rule (3), he shall be liable for any such costs as the Court may award and shall be precluded from any fresh suit in respect of such or such part of the claim.We have heard Ms. Kunika, learned counsel for the appellant, who the case very ably before us and Mr. P. Sheokand, learned counsel for the Company, who left no stone unturned while making his Withdrawal of the earlier complaint At the very outset, we would like to record that, having not argued, before the State Commission, the point of the present complaint being barred in view of the withdrawal of the earlier complaint, the National Commission was not justified, on the facts of the present case, in allowing the respondent- Insurance Company to urge that point therefrom.It is very clear from the order of the State Commission that only two points were argued by the Insurance Company.Para 6 of the order of the State Commission is extracted Learned counsel for the Company has assailed the order of the District Forum by raising two-fold arguments.Firstly, that there was delay of 6 days in giving to the Insurance Company and secondly that the key was left in the truck by driver and the truck was left unattended on the road.In any event, we are convinced that interest of justice requires that the appellant, in the peculiar facts and of this case, should not be non-suited on the ground that his earlier complaint was withdrawn.We say so for the following reasons- Firstly, the original Complaint No.515 was filed on when the Insurance Company had not taken any decision on the claim.In fact, the Complainant had alleged that the Insurance Company was lingering on with the issue and had complained of not rendering sufficient service Secondly, pending that complaint, it was on that the repudiation letter was issued on purported breach of Condition Nos.1 5 of the Policy Thirdly, we find that a separate proceeding has been drawn up recording the of only the lawyer of the Complainant.The of the lawyer stated that I, Surender Kumar Gulia, Advocate, state that I do not want to proceed with my case.It may be Fourthly, in the complaint filed on the appellant avers that since the lawyer for the opposite party Insurance Company was taking numerous dates for arguments, his counsel getting annoyed with the of the advocate of the opposite party withdrew the above said case by mistake.Fifthly, the appellant further avers that the withdrawal was unfortunate and he ought not to have prejudiced for the deeds of his lawyer.Sixthly, the finding of the National Commission is also factually erroneous, on this score.The learned counsel for the appellant drew our to para 9 of the order of the National Commission wherein the following erroneous finding was recorded.It is not disputed that earlier also, the complainant had filed consumer complaint no.515 of 2009 against the opposite party Insurance company on the same cause of action.Perusal of record would show that aforesaid complaint filed by the complainant in respect of repudiation of insurance claim regarding the same theft was withdrawn by the complainant on Copy of the relevant order in CC No.515 of 2009 is on the record.The order is reproduced as under of learned counsel for the complainant for withdrawal of the complaint recorded separately.In view of the the complaint of the complainant is hereby as withdrawn.File be consigned to record room after due compliance.It will be noticed that the National Commission was under the wrong impression that the original Complaint No.515 of 2009 was filed in respect of repudiation of the insurance claim and it on the erroneous premise that having challenged the repudiation in Complaint No.515, the withdrawal of the complaint on was fatal to the appellant.The original Complaint No.515 of 2009 was filed on and the Company repudiated the claim only on In view of the foregoing, it has to be that the complaint No.515 was filed after theft due to of claim by the Insurance Company.The repudiation of the claim was made during the pendency of the said complaint, purportedly due to breach of condition no.1 and 5.The said complaint was withdrawn by the advocate of the complainant on the pretext of the case being prolonged by the advocate of the Insurance Company, without having express instructions for withdrawal of the said complaint.However, for the fault of the advocate, the complainant cannot be made to suffer.Finally, the of the complaint was made by the National Commission under the wrong pretext that the earlier complaint had challenged the order of repudiation.Thus, in our view, the complaint cannot be thrown out on the threshold of Order Rule (1)(4) CPC and in the peculiar facts, it requires consideration on merits.In the facts of the present case, the main question that falls for consideration is Whether the delay of 6 days in the Insurance Company about the theft comes within the purview of breach of Condition No.1 and also whether on facts there was breach of condition No.5 of the insurance policy to justify the rejection of the claim in toto?A careful perusal of Condition No.1 shows that notice is to be given in writing to the Insurance Company immediately upon of any accidental loss or damage.The later part of the clause says that in case of theft or criminal act, which may be subject of a claim under the policy, the insured shall give immediate notice to the police and cooperate with the Insurance Company in securing the conviction of the offender.In support of this to Condition No.1 and to bolster her plea that the did not breach Condition No.1, learned counsel for the appellant relied on the recent judgment of this Court in Jaina Construction Company vs. Oriental Insurance Company Limited and Another, 4 SCC 527, wherein relying on and reiterating the judgment of a three- Judge Bench in Gurshinder Singh vs. Shriram General Insurance Co. Ltd. (2020) 11 SCC 612, this Court held as follows- At the outset, it may be noted that there being a conflict of decisions of the Bench of two Judges of this Court in Om Prakash v. Reliance General Insurance, (2017) 9 SCC 724 and in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Parvesh Chander Chadha, (2018) 9 SCC 798, on the question as to whether the delay occurred in informing the Insurance Company about the of the theft of the vehicle, though the FIR was immediately, would disentitle the claimant of the insurance claim, the matter was to a Bench.The Bench in Gurshinder Singh v. Shriram General Insurance Co. Ltd., (2020) 11 SCC 612 in similar case as on hand, the very Condition 1 of the insurance contract and observed as under (SCC pp.618-21, paras 9-15, 17 20) In our view, applying the aforesaid principles, Condition 1 of the standard form for commercial vehicles package policy will have to be into two parts.The perusal of the first part of Condition 1 would reveal that it provides that a notice shall be given in writing to the company immediately upon the of any accidental loss or damage.It further provides that in the event of any claim and the insured shall give all such information and as the company shall require.It provides that every letter, claim, writ, summons and or process or copy thereof shall be forwarded to the insurance company immediately on receipt by the insured.It further provides that a notice shall also be given in writing to the company immediately by the insured if he shall have knowledge of any impending prosecution inquest or fatal inquiry in respect of any which may give rise to a claim under this policy.13.We find that the second part of Condition 1 deals with the theft or criminal act other than the accident.It provides that in case of theft or criminal act which may be the subject of a claim under the policy, the insured shall give immediate notice to the police and cooperate with the company in securing the conviction of the offender.The object behind giving immediate notice to the police appears to be that if the police is immediately informed about the theft or any criminal act, the police machinery can be set in motion and steps for recovery of the vehicle could be In a case of theft, the insurance company or a surveyor would have a limited role.It is the police, who acting on the FIR of the insured, will be required to take immediate steps for tracing and recovering the vehicle.Per contra, the surveyor of the insurance company, at the most, could ascertain the factum regarding the theft of the vehicle.It is further to be noted that, in the event, after the registration of an FIR, the police recovering the vehicle and returning the same to the insured, there would be no occasion to lodge a claim for compensation on account of the policy.It is only when the police are not in a position to trace and recover the vehicle and the final report is lodged by the police after the vehicle is not traced, the insured would be in a position to lodge his claim for compensation.16.That the term cooperate as used under the contract needs to be in the facts and While the duty to cooperate for the insured, inter alia, the court should have regard to those breaches by the insured which are prejudicial to the insurance company.Usually, mere delay in informing the theft to the insurer, when the same was already informed to the law authorities, cannot amount to a breach of duty to cooperate of the insured.18.-19.We, hold that when an insured has lodged the FIR immediately after the theft of a vehicle occurred and when the police after have lodged a final report after the vehicle was not traced and when the surveyors investigators appointed by the insurance company have found the claim of the theft to be genuine, then mere delay in the insurance company about the of the theft cannot be a ground to deny the claim of the insured.In the opinion of the Court the aforestated ratio of the judgment clinches the issue involved in the case on hand.In the instant case also, the FIR was lodged immediately on the next day of the of theft of the vehicle by the complainant.The accused were also arrested and however, the vehicle could not be traced out.Of course, it is true that there was a delay of about five months on the part of the complainant in informing and lodging its claim before the Insurance Company, it is pertinent to note that the Insurance Company has not repudiated the claim on the ground that it was not genuine.It has repudiated only on the ground of delay.When the complainant had lodged the FIR immediately after the theft of the vehicle, and when the police after the had arrested the accused and also filed challan before the court concerned, and when the claim of the insured was not found to be not genuine, the Insurance Company could not have repudiated the claim merely on the ground that there was a delay in the Insurance Company about the of the theft.The above judgments put the matter and the controversy to rest.There was no breach of Condition No.1 in the present case.In the present case, after the incident of theft on FIR was on The was also given to the Insurance Company admittedly on The Police have also reported the vehicle as untraced as the records indicate.Insofar as the alleged breach of Condition No.5 is concerned, it is seen from the record that the driver of the claimant left the key in the keyhole of the vehicle when he got down to search the location of Mittal Farm, where he had to unload the stone dust.The investigator the repudiation of claim because, according to him, steps to safeguard the vehicle insured were not taken by the driver.It is contended by the appellant that breach of condition No.5, if any, cannot result in total repudiation of the claim.It is argued that the claim ought to be settled on basis, as was ordered by the District Forum and the State Commission.Reliance is placed on Nitin Khandelwal (supra) and Amalendu Sahoo (supra).The learned Counsel for the opposed these and prayed for of the Appeal.It is argued by him that, while in Nitin Khandelwal (supra) and in Amalendu Sahoo (supra) the cause of repudiation was not germane to the theft, in the present case, the cause was germane to the theft.The learned Counsel supported the findings as recorded in the order impugned.A reading of the facts of the case in Nitin Khandelwal (supra), reveal that the repudiation was on the ground that the vehicle was being used as a taxi and in Amalendu Sahoo (supra), it was on the ground that the vehicle was being used on hire.In our view, that would not make any to the ratio that is deducible from those judgments.It is well settled in a long line of judgments of this Court that any violation of the condition should be in the nature of a fundamental breach so as to deny the claimant any amount.see Manjeet Singh vs. National Insurance Company Limited and Another, (2018) 2 SCC 108 B.V. vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., Officer, Hassan, (1996) 4 SCC 647, National Insurance Co. Ltd.Vs. Swaran Singh and Others, (2004) 3 SCC 297 and Lakhmi Chand vs. Reliance General Insurance, (2016) 3 SCC 100 It is an admitted position in the Repudiation Letter and the Survey Report that the theft did happen.What is alleged is that the Claimant was negligent in leaving the vehicle unattended with the key in the Theft is defined in Section 378 of the IPC as follows- to take dishonestly any moveable property out of the of any person without that persons consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft.As will be seen from the theft occurs when any person intended to take dishonestly any moveable property out of the of any person without that persons consent, moves that property in order to such taking.It is not the case of the Insurance Company that the Claimant consented or connived in the removal of the vehicle, in which event that would not be theft, in the eye of law.Could it be said, as is said in the repudiation letter, that the theft of the vehicle was totally the result of driver Mam Chand leaving the vehicle unattended with the key in the On the facts of this case, the answer has to be in the negative.It is noticed in the repudiation letter that the driver Mam Chand had, after alighting from the vehicle, gone to enquire about the location of Mittals Farm and that after he went some distance, he heard the sound of the starting of the vehicle and it being stolen away.The time gap the driver alighting from the vehicle and noticing the theft, is very short as is clear from the facts of the case.It cannot be said, in such that leaving the key of the vehicle in the was an open to steal the vehicle.The Court of Appeal in England, in the case of David Topp vs. London Country Bus (South West) Limited, 1993 EWCA Civ 15 had occasion to consider the issue, though in the context of of the owner of the vehicle for a fatal accident.The facts as set out in the judgment are as follows- In with usual practice, the driver, Mr. Green, left the bus in that lay-by at the bus stop at about 2.35 p.m. on 24 th April 1988.He left it unlocked, with the key in it.He had then a 40 minute rest period before resuming his duties, driving a different bus.There was an arrangement under which the drivers could spend their rest period in the hospital.The expectation was that another driver, about eight minutes after Mr. Green had left the bus in the lay-by, would pick the bus up and drive the same route.But the other driver, who should have picked the bus up at about 2.43 p.m., did not do so because he was feeling unwell.His shift would have been overtime, and he did not report for his overtime.The bus remained in the lay-by.Mr. Green saw it there later and reported that it was still standing there.there is no doubt that the depot knew that the bus was there.But, possibly because of shortage of drivers or staff, nothing was done to pick the bus up that evening.It was taken by somebody who has never been traced just before at night, driven for a relatively short distance until the point where Mrs. Topp was knocked down and killed, and it was abandoned round the corner from there.Referring to the judgment of Lord Justice Robert Goff in P.Perl (Exporters) Ltd. vs. Camden London Borough Council 1984 QB 342, the Court of Appeal held as under- In so far as the case is put on the basis that to leave the bus unlocked and with the key in the on the Highway near a public house is to create a special risk in a special category, it is pertinent to refer to a passage in the judgment of Lord Justice Robert Goff (as he then was) in P. Perl (Exporters) Ltd. V. Camden London Borough Council 1984 QB 342 at page 359E-F where he said In particular, I have in mind certain cases where the defendant presents the wrongdoer with the means to commit the wrong, in where it is obvious or very likely that he will do so as, for example, where he hands over a car to be driven by a person who is drunk, or plainly incompetent, who then runs over the plaintiff But the sort of cases to which Lord Justice Robert Goff was there are far different from the present case.It may be that that there is no that the malefactor had been frequenting the public house that is shown in the picture we do not know who he was, nor is there any or presumption that persons who do frequent that particular public house are particularly likely to steal vehicles and engage in joy-riding.is ours) The above reasoning appeals to us to conclude that the present case was an eminently fit case, where the claim at 75 ought to have been awarded on a basis.Even if there was some on the peculiar facts of this case, it was not a fundamental breach of Condition No.5 warranting total repudiation.It was rightly so ordered by the District Forum and affirmed by the State Commission.Learned counsel for the Insurance Company, in his written has placed before us an unreported order dated passed by this Court in SLP (C) No.6518 of 2018 titled Kanwarjit Singh Kang vs. M s Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. Anr.to support his case on the breach of Condition No.5.We have carefully perused the order.In the said order, it is recorded that concurrently the Claimant lost before the fora below and it is also recorded that the State Commission did not find the ground of leaving the keys in the vehicle to be a valid reason to repudiate the claim.However, on the ground of unexplained and inordinate delay in lodging the FIR, the repudiation was upheld.In that case, while the loss was on the to Police was only on so clearly it was a breach of Condition No.1.No doubt, in the penultimate of the order it is recorded that the want of reasonable care on the part of the petitioner in that case operated heavily against the petitioner and it was concluded that the repudiation could not be faulted.However, the primary reason for repudiation was the violation of condition No.1 viz.the delay in to the Police.Further since there was a fundamental breach of Condition No.1, there was no occasion to raise points for of claim on basis.There is no whisper about the breach of Condition No.5 being not a fundamental breach.We find the present case, on facts, completely different as there is no breach of Condition No.1 because the to the police was immediate.There have been concurrent awards by the District Forum and State Commission on basis by applying Nitin Khandelwal (supra) and Amalendu Sahoo (supra).Hence, the order will in no manner the In Amalendu Sahoo (supra), this Court noticed the guidelines issued by the New India Assurance Co. Ltd. in settling claims on basis.The guidelines read as under- Sl.No.Description of Under declaration of licensed Deduct 3 years in carrying capacity.premium from the amount of claim or deduct 25 of claim amount, whichever is higher.Overloading of vehicles beyond Pay claims not 75 of licensed carrying capacity.admissible claim.Any other breach of Pay up to 75 of admissible warranty condition of policy claim.including as to use.The above guidelines were followed by this Court in Amalendu Sahoo (supra) as is clear from para 14 of the said judgment.The District Forum and the State Commission have rightly applied Amalendu Sahoo (supra) to the facts of the present case and awarded 75 on basis.Nitin Khandelwal (supra) and Amalendu Sahoo (supra) lay down the correct formula that where there is some contributory factor, a deduction from the assured amount would be all that the Insurance Company can aspire to deduct.We are inclined to accept the plea of the appellant that in the case at hand, on the facts governing the scenario, Clause of the table set out in para 14 of Amalendu Sahoo (supra) is and the District Forum and the State Commission were justified in awarding the entire 75 of the admissible claim.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simplex Concrete Company (R-2 herein) for Truck No.MPF 7567, which was insured with R-1.On while the appellant was loading poles pillars in that truck, the chain pulley broke and the poles fell on the left arm of the appellant resulting in a compound fracture of her left arm as well as damage to the nerves etc.By claiming that due to the injury, the appellant has suffered permanent total disablement, as there was no grip left in her left arm, compensation was sought from R-2.R-2 claimed itself to be insured with R-1 and the appellant to claim compensation from R-1.As no compensation was paid, the appellant filed petition before the Workmens Compensation Commissioner (in short, the Commissioner) under the provisions of the Workmens Compensation Act, 1923, now known as the Employees Compensation Act, 1923 (in short, the Act).Before the Commissioner, R-2 did not dispute the facts set up in the claim petition, rather he claimed the benefit of insurance cover under a policy issued by R-1.Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 2 of 16 R-1 (the Insurer), though did not deny of an insurance cover in favour of R-2, took usual pleas to defeat the claim which need not be elaborated here, as there is no appeal by R-1 against the order of the High Court fastening on it under the insurance policy.During the course of the proceedings before the Commissioner, the appellant examined herself.She proved that, she was working as a loading /unloading labourer of Truck No.MPF 7567, owned by R-2 and insured with R-1 on the fateful day while she was loading poles pillars on the said truck along with other labourers, the chain pulley broke and the poles fell on her, resulting in injuries to her left hand she was admitted to the hospital for a period 10 days and due to the injuries sustained in that accident, her left hand has become completely because of no movement in the fingers of her left hand on account of nerve damage.Various documents including salary certificate (Exh.P-5), discharge card (Exh.P-7) and certificate issued by Medical Board (Exh.P-8) were produced to support her claim.The appellant also examined Dr. Ravi Shankar Chowdhary, an Orthopaedist and a member of the District Medical Board (in short, the Board), Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 3 of 16 who deposed that on the appellant gave an application to the Board to ascertain the of her Whereupon, she was examined and it was found that there was a compound fracture in her left arm and plates and screws were installed in her radial and ulna bone after operation, as a result, the fingers of her left hand had lost movement and the muscles had become thin.The doctor proved that a certificate permanent to the extent of 50 with a declaration that she is unfit for labour work has been issued by the Board.Neither R-1 nor R-2 produced to rebut the led by the appellant.FINDINGS The Commissioner upon consideration of the on record found the appellant permanently unfit to do labour work, which she was doing at the time of the accident.Accordingly, appellants permanent was as total.Having that the appellant had incurred permanent total on finding that her age was 30 years and monthly wages were at the time of the accident, the Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 4 of 16 Commissioner computed the compensation payable in terms of Section 4(1)(b) of the Act as below- The age of applicant was 30 years at the time of the accident whose age factor is 207.98 as per Schedule IV of Section 4 of the Workmens Compensation Act.Multiplying this age factor by 60 of the monthly salary of Rs.given to the applicant by Rs.1800/-, the total compensation amount is Rs.3,74,364/-.After computing the compensation, the Commissioner directed as follows- the are ordered to jointly and severally deposit an amount of Rs.3,74,364/- in this Court within 45 days from the date of this order.The will be liable to deposit 9 interest from the date of this order for not depositing the compensation amount within the stipulated time.Aggrieved by the order of the Commissioner, R-1 appeal, under Section 30 of the Act, before the High Court.FINDINGS OF THE HIGH COURT The High Court did not disturb the finding of the Commissioner with regard to the of the appellant for compensation as also with regard to her age and monthly wages.However, the High Court her permanent as 40 and thereby reduced the compensation awarded.Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 5 of 16 On the extent of permanent the High Court noticed the certificate provided by the Board and observed- A perusal of the record reveals that claimant had produced certificate from District Medical Board, Jabalpur, Ex.P-8 dated whereby it is mentioned that claimant Smt.Indra Bai is an old case of compound fracture of left Radial Ulna with O. Plating and screw with contracture of fingers with wrist drop with monoparesis upper limb.was certified at 50 with further stipulation that unfit for labour job.The High Court also noticed the of the doctor who did the medical examination and observed- Dr. Ravi Shankar Choudhary was examined on behalf of the claimant, who deposed that it was a case of old compound fracture of radius and ulna bone, which was fixed through an operation by fixing plate and screw.In cross-examination, this witness admitted that except for her left hand, there is no in her body.She can carry out all the works which can be carried out by right hand.The High Court considered the decision of this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mubasir Ahmed and Another1 to observe that if there is permanent partial disablement on account of injuries not specified in Schedule 1 then loss of earning capacity is not a for of physical disablement though it is one of the factors to (2007) 2 SCC 349 Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 6 of 16 be taken into account.It also noticed another decision of this Court in Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. v. Mohd.Nasir and Another2 to observe that the extent of is to be having regard to the facts and of the case but not in an and manner.After observing as above and taking notice of a decision of the High Court, the High Court found that ends of justice will be met if 40 permanent disablement is taken into consideration for computing the compensation.Consequently, the High Court reduced the compensation awarded to the extent indicated above.Aggrieved by the judgment and order of the High Court, the appellant has Special Leave Petition under Article 136 of the of India.On this petition, notices were issued on 13.01.2023 to the respondents 1 and 2 and it was directed that no recovery of any excess amount shall be made from the petitioner.As per the office report dated despite due service on the respondents, none has on their behalf.(2009) 6 SCC 280 Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 7 of 16 We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and have perused the record.OF THE APPELLANT The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that, - firstly, appeal under section 30 of the Act is not to be unless a substantial question of law arises.In absence of any perversity in the reasoning qua the extent of it being a question of fact, the High Court erred by delving into that issue.Secondly, the High Court fell in by the permanent as 40 instead of It was urged that total disablement, whether temporary or permanent, of a workman is to be on the basis of his incapacity to perform the work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident resulting in such disablement.The appellant was a loading and unloading labourer at the time of the accident.For the purposes of loading unloading, use of both arms hands are required.The brought on record had clearly indicated that the appellants left hand was she was declared unfit for labour job.In such the Commissioner was justified in the permanent as 100 (i.e., total disablement) whereas the High Court fell in by it as 40.In support of his Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 8 of 16 the learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance on decisions of this Court in v. Manager, New India Insurance Co. Ltd.3 and Golla and Others v. Manager and Another.4 AND ANALYSIS We have considered the and have perused the record.There is no dispute the parties in respect of the following- (a) that the appellant was under employment of R-2 as a loading and unloading labourer for Truck No.MPF 7567, which was insured with R- 1 at the time of the accident (b) that the accident occurred during the course of employment (c) that at the time of accident, age of the appellant was 30 years and monthly wages were and (d) that though the Board declared her permanently disabled to the extent of 50, but certified that she is unfit for labour.(2020) 1 SCC 796 (2017) 1 SCC 45 Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 9 of 16 Section 4(1)(b) of the Act, at the relevant time, read as under- Amount of compensation.- (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the amount of compensation shall be as follows, namely- (a).Where permanent an amount equal to sixty per total disablement results cent of the monthly wages of the from the injury injured multiplied by the relevant factor Or an amount of one lakh and forty thousand rupees, whichever is more Provided that the Central Government may, by in the Official Gazette, from time to time, enhance the amount of compensation mentioned in clauses (a) and (b).Explanation I.-- For the purposes of clause (a) and clause (b), relevant factor, in relation to a workman means the factor specified in the second column of Schedule IV against the entry in the first column of that Schedule specifying the number of years which are the same as the completed years of the age of the workman on his last birthday immediately preceding the date on which the compensation fell due.Total disablement is defined by section 2(1)(l) as follows- total disablement means such disablement, whether of a temporary or permanent nature, as a workman for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident resulting in such disablement Provided that permanent total disablement shall be to result from every injury specified in Part I of Schedule I or from any combination of injuries specified in Part II thereof where the of the loss of Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 10 of 16 earning capacity, as specified in the said Part II against those injuries, amounts to one hundred per cent or more In Pratap Narain Singh Deo v. Srinivas and Another5, by a four-Judge Bench of this Court, the injured workman was a carpenter by profession and by loss of left hand above the elbow, he was evidently unfit for the work of carpentry and, the Commissioner awarded compensation by considering permanent as total i.e., 100.The employer raised an argument that the injury did not result in permanent total disablement of the workman and the Commissioner committed a gross of law in taking a view that there was total disablement.In that context, this Court held - The expression total disablement has been defined in section 2(1)(l) of the Act as follows total disablement means such disablement, whether of a temporary or permanent nature, as a workman for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident resulting in such disablement.It has not been disputed before us that the injury was of such a nature as to cause permanent disablement to the respondent, and the question for consideration is whether the disablement (1976) 1 SCC 289 Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 11 of 16 the respondent for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident.The Commissioner has examined the question and recorded his finding as follows The injured workman in this case is carpenter by professionBy loss of the left hand above the elbow, he has evidently been unfit for the work of carpenter as the work of carpentry cannot be done by one hand only.This is obviously a reasonable and correct finding.Counsel for the appellant has not been able to assail it on any ground and it does not require to be corrected in this appeal.In (supra), the issue that came for consideration before this Court was, whether a workman driver who, on account of injury on his leg, could neither stand for a long time nor fold his legs and was required to use a walking stick, and could not lift heavy objects, would be entitled for compensation by taking the as 100 or less, as per the medical opinion.Notably, in that case, the doctor had certified that the workman had suffered 37 in his whole body, and could not perform the work of a truck driver any longer.In that context, it was held It is the admitted position that the appellant can no longer pursue his vocation as a driver of heavy vehicles.The medical on record has his to stand for a long period of time, or even fold his legs.As a the appellant has got permanently to pursue his vocation as a driver.Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 12 of 16 14.As a of the accident, the appellant has been for life, since he can walk only with the help of a walking stick.He has lost the ability to work as a driver, as he would be from even getting a driving license.The prospect of securing any other manual labour job is not possible, since he would require the of a person to ensure his mobility and manage his discomfort.As a the functional suffered by the Appellant must be as 100.In light of the aforesaid decisions and the of the term total disablement as provided by clause (l) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Act, it is the functional and not just the physical which is the determining factor in whether the claimant (i.e., workman) has incurred total disablement.Thus, if the disablement incurred in an accident a workman for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident resulting in such disablement, the disablement would be taken as total for the purposes of award of compensation under section 4(1)(b) of the Act regardless of the injury sustained being not one as specified in Part I of Schedule I of the Act.The proviso to clause (l) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Act does not dilute the import of the substantive clause.Rather, it adds to it by specifying categories wherein it shall be that there is permanent total disablement.Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 13 of 16 In Mohd.Nasir (supra), which has been relied by the High Court, the workman was a cleaner.He had suffered fracture in the leg.It was held that such injury would not amount to permanent loss of the use of the entire leg.Hence, the disablement was found partial and not total.In Mubasir Ahmed (supra), another decision relied by the High Court, the matter did not relate to injuries specified in Schedule I and, as such, it was observed that the case was covered by Section of the Act.However, in that case, the Court at no stage examined whether the disablement in question had the workman from performing all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident resulting in such disablement.In other words, the Court had no occasion to examine the true import of the term total disablement as defined by Section 2(1)(l) of the Act.in our view, the decision in Mubasir Ahmed (supra) was wrongly applied by the High Court.In the instant case, on the basis of medical certificate provided by the Board, the Commissioner found the appellant unfit for labour inasmuch as there was complete loss of grip in appellants left Civil Appeal SLP (C) No.138 of 2023 Page 14 of 16 hand.Prior to the accident, the appellant worked as a loading unloading labourer.Even if she could use her right hand, the crux is whether she could be considered suitable for performing her task as a loading unloading labourer.Such a task is ordinarily performed by using both hands.There is no material on record from which it could be inferred that the appellant was skilled to perform any kind of job by use of one hand.It is also not a case where the appellant had the skill to perform her job by using machines which the appellant could operate by using one hand.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

order.The appellants were convicted by the Trial Court under Sections 148, 323, 325 and 307 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).They were to undergo six months rigorous imprisonment under Section 148 read with Section 149 as well as for Section 323 read with Section 149, two years under Section 325 read with Section 149 IPC and seven years under Section 307 read with Section 149 IPC.The High Court vide order dated May the appeal of the appellants.However, by a subsequent order dated May 28, 2010, part was modified by the High Court.The reason stated for the said was that an interim order dated May 28, 2010, was passed in the said appeal reducing the from seven years to five years under Section 307 read with Section 149 IPC but the said was not incorporated into the detailed judgement.It is a case in which both the parties suffered injuries.The FIR No.75 dated 27.3.1997 was on the complaint of Page 2 of 8 Criminal Appeal Nos.of 2011 Jagdish Chand alleging that at about 8.00 a.m. in the morning of 27.3.1997, Surender Singh tried to drive his tractor trolley from the disputed passage, the bara of the house of Jagdish Chand.Rajesh Kumar, nephew of Jagdish Chand asked him not to do so.Accused Man Singh, Ajmer Singh, Nanak Singh and Gurdhian Singh were sitting in the They attacked Rajesh Kumar and Jagdish Chand with lathi.a lathi blow was given on the head of Lajwanti (mother of Ravi Kumar, Rajesh Kumar and Sanjeev Kumar).On alarm being raised, Ravi Kumar and Sanjeev Kumar (nephews of Jagdish Chand) came to save them.Gurdhian Singh gave a kassi (spade) blow on the head of Rajesh Kumar.Nanak Singh gave a lathi blow to Ravi Kumar, whereas Surinder Singh gave a lathi blow to Sanjeev Kumar.On hearing the alarm, number of villagers gathered.The injured were taken to hospital and they were medically examined.As against this, multiple injuries were suffered by the appellants.They were also medically examined at PHC Panjokra.According to the there was altercation Harbans Kaur wife of Ajmer Singh and Lajwanti.As a result, the male members of both the parties collected and there was free fight.Page 3 of 8 Criminal Appeal Nos.of 2011 The dispute the parties, as claimed, was with to use of the disputed passage by the appellants.As both the parties suffered injuries in the fight, it cannot be held that no such incident had taken place.The argument raised by the learned counsel for the appellants was that in the case in hand, the complainant party was the aggressor as on daytoday basis they used to scold them while they were using the passage on the land, which is in the name of Gram The complainant party was treating that portion of the land to be their own.In fact, immediately after the incident on 27.3.1997 a civil suit for permanent was filed by the complainant party, namely, Jagdish Chand and Krishan son of Kundan against Ajmer Singh, Nanak Singh sons of Jiwan Singh and Dhyan Singh, Man Singh sons of Ajmer Singh and Surender Singh son of Shamsher.The prayer in the suit was to restrain the defendants therein from using bara of the plaintiffs as passage.The suit was filed on 31.3.1997, which was on No of was passed in favour of plaintiffs therein pertaining to Khasra No.117, which was claimed to be the property Page 4 of 8 Criminal Appeal Nos.of 2011 of the plaintiffs as it was found to be owned by Gram and for Rafiamm.He further submitted that number of persons on the appellant side also suffered injuries and some of them were found to be grievous.However, the courts below have failed to take that into consideration.In fact, it was a case of The incident took place outside the precincts of complainant party, hence the appellants cannot be said to be cannot be established as there was no weapon used.They were merely having their agricultural implements with them and it was the normal time to go to the fields as the incident happened at about 8.00 a.m.The allegation is that the appellants were going in the when on the of the complainant party, the incident happened.On the other hand, the argument of learned counsel for the State was that it is a case in which the appellants were found to be They had caused grievous injuries to the complainant party.Even if they suffered certain injuries, those were in of their right to private The in Page 5 of 8 Criminal Appeal Nos.of 2011 the form of of injured cannot be Besides the injured were also produced who the version of the prosecution.Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record.Date of incident, as such, is not in dispute.It has also not come on record that the appellants who were stated to be and have been convicted, used any weapons as such or they had gone to the place of incident with their mind.Even the case set up by the complainant party was that they were passing through the passage in a trolley.In fight, lathi and kassi (spade) were used.These are the normal agricultural implements which are used in the rural areas, which the appellants were carrying in their trolley.As is evident from the record, the dispute was with regard to the use of passage by the appellants which the complainant party was claiming to be its own.Another fact which has come on record is that there is a in a civil case filed by the complainant party immediately after the incident, in which it Page 6 of 8 Criminal Appeal Nos.of 2011 was held that the passage belongs to the Gram and the same is Rafiamm.No doubt, there are injuries suffered by the complainant party.However, the fact remains that the

No.26 of 2018, by which the High Court the appeal filed by the convicts (appellants herein) and thereby affirmed the judgment and order of conviction and passed by the Additional Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by Deepak Singh Judge, 2nd Court, Katwa, Burdwan, West Date 103047 IST Reason Bengal in the Trial No.13 of 2014 holding the appellants guilty for the offence punishable under Sections 498A, 304B read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short, the IPC).The Trial Court them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three years with a fine of Rs.each for the offence punishable under Section 498A of the IPC and rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years for the offence punishable under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code.CASE OF THE PROSECUTION- The appellant No.1 Saha) is the son of the appellants Nos.2 and 3 resply.The appellant No.4 is the younger brother of the appellant No.1.The appellant No.1 was married to the namely, Tuli Shah.The marriage was solemnized on On 19th 2011, the de facto Shankar Shah (PW-1) lodged an First Information Report at the Ketugram Police Station stating that his niece Tuli Shah was married to the appellant No.1 past couple of months.He further stated that as the parents of Tuli Shah passed away while she was of a very young age, it is he who took care of Tuli Shah and brought her up.At the time of marriage, cash and gold ornaments were given to the family of the husband of Tuli Shah.However, within a short time, the appellants started harassing the for want of more dowry.It is the case of the prosecution that on 16 th 2011, the committed suicide by consuming poison on account of incessant harassment by the appellants at her matrimonial home.Upon completion of was filed for the offences above.The Trial Court framed charge for the offence punishable under Sections 498A, 304B read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code.The accused persons pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.In the course of the trial, the prosecution examined as many as 11 and also led documentary The Trial Court upon appreciation of the on record came to the conclusion that the prosecution had established its case against the accused persons beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly held them guilty.The appellants herein being with the judgment and order of conviction and passed by the Trial Court, went in appeal before the High Court.The High Court thought fit to affirm the judgment and order of conviction passed by the Trial Court and the appeal accordingly.In such the appellants are here before this Court with the present appeal.We take notice of the fact that the appellant No.3 Pratima Saha (Mother-in-law) of the passed away during the pendency of this appeal.ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS- The learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the Trial Court as well as the High Court committed a serious in holding the appellants guilty of the offence they were charged with.According to the learned counsel this is a case of no He laid much emphasis on the fact that the prosecution has not been able to establish the exact cause of death.He would argue that if it is the case of the prosecution that the committed suicide due to incessant harassment, then prosecution has to establish on the basis of on record as to what was the exact cause of death.The learned counsel laid much emphasis on the fact that the post-mortem report does not say anything about the exact cause of death.He further submitted that even the report is silent about any traces of poison in the viscera.In such according to the learned counsel, the prosecution has not been able to establish that the case on hand is one of unnatural death.He further submitted that the appellants have already undergone almost six years of He would submits that assuming for the moment that there was harassment for the purpose of dowry, at best, they could have been convicted for the offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, but, in any event, not under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code.In such to above, the learned counsel prayed that there being merit in his appeal, the same be allowed and the appellants be acquitted of all the charges.ON BEHALF OF THE STATE- On the other hand, this appeal has been opposed by Mr. Avishkar Singhvi, the learned counsel appearing for the State of West Bengal.He would submit that no not to speak of any of law could be said to have been committed by the Courts below in holding the appellants guilty of the offence with which they were charged.The learned counsel laid much emphasis on the fact that within couple of months from the date of marriage, the died at her matrimonial home under According to him, there is thumping on record to indicate that there was incessant harassment to the by all the appellants for want of dowry.The learned counsel invited the of this Court to Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (for short, the Evidence Act) which raises a presumption against the accused.Section 113B of the Evidence Act reads thus- Section 113B.Presumption as to dowry death.-- When the question is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman had been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in with, any demand for dowry, the court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death.The learned counsel drew a fine Sections 113A and 113B resply of the Evidence Act.In Section 113A, the Legislature has thought fit to use the word may.in a given set of facts, the Court may presume whereas under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act the word used is shall.In view of the word shall, the Court is left with no other option but to draw the presumption.He would submit that there is on record to indicate that the died on account of consumption of poison.He would submit that there was long delay in forwarding the sample of viscera collected during the course of post-mortem to the Forensic Science Laboratory and perhaps on account of delay, the report is silent in so far as any traces of poison being found in the viscera.In such to above, Mr. Avishkar Singhvi, the learned counsel prayed that there being no merit in this appeal the same may be Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the only question that falls for our consideration is whether the High Court committed any in passing the impugned judgment.ANALYSIS Indisputably, the post mortem report is silent in so far as the exact cause of death is concerned.There is no escape from the fact that the viscera report is also silent in so far as any traces of poison being found therein.However, the Trial Court in its judgment has the aforesaid aspect of the matter in a quite satisfactory manner, which reads as under- It is the opinion of Modi that in some cases, which had definite signs of death from poisoning, the Chemical Examiner failed to detect any poison and in that case the duty of the Judge is to weigh the the symptoms, post-mortem etc., to reach to the just conclusion.It was also the opinion of Modi that unsuitable samples, incorrect sampling sites, delayed storage, delay in examination of the viscera, use of wrong technique may frustrate or distort proper analysis and the final outcome may be wrong.I have gone through the observations made by Modi HWV Cox in this regard.I have gone through the observations made by them in respect various poisons and the symptoms.As per the inquest report (Ext-2), the police officer had noticed that froth was coming out from the right nostril.The skin color noted by the police officer was whitish.During post mortem it was noticed that Rigor Mortis was not present, the eyes were half closed, froth was coming out from the nose and mouth.On opening of the body the Oesophagus, lungs, trachea and bronchial trees were found congested.In the stomach the doctor found food particles and fluid with pungent smell.On analysis of various cases Modi Cox had framed a guideline of detection of poison from the symptoms.According to them, white froth may come out from mouth and nose in case of Opium or its alkaloids.It was also their opinion that in that case all the internal organs like stomach or lungs may be congested.They have also opined that if on opening of stomach smell may found, that may be the effects of the poison like compounds, opium, formaldehyde etc.Here, in this case the post mortem observations shows that it was definitely a case of death due to poisoning.It is fact that the nature of poison could not be ascertained but all the symptoms proves that the death of Tuli was due to consumption of poison and there is no other probable cause of her death.Obviously the death was caused otherwise than under the normal (Emphasis supplied) The aforesaid findings recorded by the trial court were looked into by the High Court in 13 of its impugned judgment as under- The accused persons in vain sought to set up a futile plea by way of suggestion to the prosecution that Tuli died under normal due to illness and not by consuming poison.This plea could not be by any iota of Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act provides that when any fact is specially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of providing that fact is upon him.It is not in dispute that Tuli was married to the appellant No.1 on 24 th February, 2011.The fact that Tuli died in her matrimonial house within seven months of her marriage has not been denied.From the of PW-9 Dr. N. Ghatak it transpires that no poison was found in the viscera sample of which was nd on 22 February, 2012.PW-10 is the medical officer who held post-mortem examination over the dead body of Tuli on 17th 2011.This witness testified in his that on visceral examination odour material with pungent smell was found in the stomach.PW-10 opined that if anyone takes poison, such kind of pungent smell may be found.PW-10 did not give any conclusive opinion as to the cause of death since the viscera was sent for chemical examination.Being quizzed in course of PW-10 admitted that if delay is caused in sending viscera sample for chemical examination, the poison might not be found.In the present case, the viscera was for chemical examination on 22nd February, 2012 that is, after five months.There is nothing on record to show that the viscera sample was properly during the aforesaid period.Though no poison could be in the viscera sample of the the factual position of the case in hand by the of the and the inquest report go to show that death of Tuli had occurred otherwise than under normal The inquest report lends to the prosecution case as it appears therefrom that death of Tuli was caused by consuming poison.At the time of inquest it was noted that froth was coming out from the mouth and nose of the The expression normal apparently means natural death.In other words, the expression otherwise than under normal means death not being in the usual course but apparently under In the case of Bhupendra Versus State of Madhya Pradesh reported in 2013(4) Crimes 480(Supreme Court) it was held that chemical examination of viscera is not mandatory in every case of dowry death.For the purpose of Section 304 B IPC mere fact of an unnatural death is sufficient to invite a presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act.The relevant 26 of the judgment in Bhupendras case (supra) is quoted These decisions clearly bring out that a chemical examination of the viscera is not mandatory in every case of a dowry death even when a viscera report is sought for, its absence is not necessarily fatal to the case of the prosecution when an unnatural death punishable under Section 304-B of the IPC or under Section 306 of the IPC takes place in a case of an unnatural death Section 304-B of the IPC (read with the presumption under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act, 1872) or Section 306 of the IPC(read with the presumption under Section 113- A of the Evidence Act, 1872) as long as there is of poisoning, of the poison may not be absolutely necessary.Reverting to the case in hand, from the on record it is clear that death of Tuli had occurred otherwise than under normal (Emphasis supplied) There is on record to indicate that the case on hand is one of suicide by poison.The PW-10 (Medical Officer) who performed the post mortem has deposed that odour material with pungent smell was found in the stomach.The expert opined that in cases of consumption of poison, such kind of pungent smell would be found.The PW-10 admitted that if there is any delay in forwarding the viscera sample for chemical examination, the poison may not be Unfortunately, in the case on hand, the viscera was by the FSL for chemical analysis on 22nd February, 2012 that is after a period of almost five months.In a research article titled, Negative viscera report and its medico-legal aspects, it has been mentioned that in many cases, the viscera report is negative on three major basis, namely it can be procedure based, sample based or lab based.The said research paper reveals that there are in which viscera test may not reveal the of compounds from the following Sample quantities by FSL much less than those prescribed for optimal analysis Required quantity and quality of not used during sampling time and container not maintained for preservation of sample Difficulty in detection of poison due to vomiting, purging or from the system by the kidneys or due to prolonged stay in the hospital immediately prior to the death Not sending stomach wash (gastric lavage) and vomit along with viscera for examination Some organic poison decompose due to improper preservation or control Site of sample collection on the body also play an important role In postmortem many poisons present in the tissue undergo chemical changes which cannot be in routine analysis This Court in Mahabir Mandal v. State of Bihar, (1972) 1 SCC 748, looked into the observations found at page 477 of the Modis Medical Jurisprudence and edition) and held that under some if the whole of the poison has disappeared from the lungs by evaporation, or has been removed from the stomach and intestines by vomiting and purging, and after absorption has been detoxified, conjugated and eliminated from the system by the kidneys and other channels, it is possible that there may not be traces of poison.Thus, the absence of detection of poison in the viscera report alone need not be treated as a conclusive proof of the fact that the victim has not died of poison.In Mahabir Mandal (supra), this Court has ob- served as under- Empty has been made by Mr.Chari to report dated 23, 1963 of the Chemical Examiner, according to whom no poison could be in the viscera of Indira This would not, in our opinion, militate against the conclusion that the death of the was due to poisoning.There are several poisons particularly of the synthetic hyp- notics and alkaloids groups, which do not leave any signs as can be noticed on post mortem examina- tion.(Emphasis supplied) The above observation of this Court was based on the made in the Modis Medical Jurisprudence and Those were also to by this Court, which are as follows- It is quite possible that a person may die from the effects of a poison, and yet none may be found in the body after death, if the whole of the poison has disappeared from the lungs by evaporation, or has been removed from the stomach and intestines by vomiting and purging, and after absorption has been detoxified, conjugated and elimi- nated from the system by the kidneys and other channels.Certain poisons may not be in the viscera, as they have no reliable tests, while some organic poisons, especially the alkaloids and glu- cosides, may be oxidation during life or by putrefaction after death, be split up into other which have no characteris- tic reactions sufficient for their identi- fication.(Emphasis supplied) As pointed out by this Court in a number of cases, where the dies as a result of poi- soning, it is difficult to isolate the poison and recognise it.Lack of positive evi- dence in this respect would not result in throwing out the entire prosecution case, if the other cir- cumstances clearly point out the guilt of the ac- cused.According to Modis Medical Jurisprudence and 23rd Edition, Editors K. and Amrit K Patnaik, the materials should be sent to the concerned Forensic Science Laboratory, through the concerned police station as quickly as possible.Otherwise, the poison may not be during the analysis of the vis- cera, even though they may contain some poison.Ken Kulig MD, in Critical Care Secrets (Fourth Edition), 2007 states that the gastric lavage must be performed soon after ingestion to be at all in removing the drugs from the stomach.For this reason, many do not lavage patients who have overdosed if more than 1 hour has elapsed since ingestion.We are conscious of the legal that while dealing with a case of circumstantial the Court has to be A note of caution was sounded by a Bench of this Court in Raghav Tripathi v. State of P. AIR 1963 SC 74 quoting (AIR p. 89 para 60) from R. vs. Hodge (1838) 2 Law CC 227.The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting to one another, and even in straining them a little, if need be, to force them to form parts of one con- nected whole and the more ingenious the mind of the the more likely was it, considering such matter, to overreach and mislead itself, to supply some little link that is wanting, to take for granted some fact consistent with its previous the- ories and necessary to render them com- plete.Thus, the Court should not unwittingly fall into the same dangerous trap which the Constitu- tion Bench has cautioned to be guarded against.Considering the overall on record, we find it difficult to take the view that in the absence of any positive viscera report, the prose- cution could be said to have failed to establish its case.For the foregoing reasons, we have reached to the conclusion that we should not with the concurrent findings recorded by the two Courts below.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nambi approached the learned Single Judge of the High Court praying for a direction to the State Government to take action against the police officials.The learned Single Judge allowed the said writ petition.The matter was carried before the Bench of the High Court of Kerala.The Bench overturned the decision of the learned Single Judge setting aside the order of the State Government declining to take action against the police officials and remitted the matter to the State Government.The judgment and order passed by the Bench of the High Court was the subject matter before this Court by way of Criminal Appeal Nos.of 2018.By a detailed judgment dated 14.09.2018, reported in (2018) 10 SCC 804, this Court allowed the said appeals.This Court directed the State of Kerala to pay a sum of Rs.50 lacs towards compensation to the appellant S.

no.1, by its letter dated 30.08.1996 to respondent no.2, accepted the short delivery.On the appellant complainant made a modest claim against the respondents for refund of full freight.In response to the said claim, respondent no.2 confirmed having short 104 cartons out of 288 cartons but did not state whether the other cartons had arrived at the destination.The appellant served the legal notice dated 04.08.1997 on the respondents, which evoked no response.Ultimately, the appellant complainant lodged a complaint before the NCDRC with the prayer that respondent no.1 be directed to refund a sum of Rs.being the fair charges for the pay a sum of Rs.20 lakhs as compensation for loss of and reputation pay US being the value of the goods short pay interest 18 as well as cost of which was disposed of as abovesaid.Hence these appeals.Learned counsel for the appellant would submit that admittedly, the shipments booked by the appellant on 24.07.1996, which were to be by 31.07.1996, were to the handling agent of the Consignee only in the month of 1996 from to with delay of more than 40 days.Learned counsel submitted that the goods were to respondent no.1 on a specific that the same will be within seven days, time is the of the contract the parties.It is next argued that in the case in hand, it is clear from the material on record that respondent no.1 has been highly negligent in rendering its services to the appellant.Learned counsel further submits that once the NCDRC arrives at the conclusion that there is delay in delivery of due to of respondent no.1, fair, just and reasonable compensation must be awarded in with conditions of the contract and provisions of the Carriage by Air Act, 1972.Per contra, learned counsel for respondent no.1 submitted that there was no deficiency in service by respondent no.1.All reasonable care in performing its duties under the contract of carriage were discharged diligently.He would submit that no specific instructions were given by the appellant with regard to the time by which the had to reach its destination, time was not the of contract into the parties.Learned counsel next submits that respondent no.1 should not be held liable for delay in service, as in spite of being aware of the fact, the appellant sent the through Kuwait Airways, which has various stops over at Kuwait, Chicago and Memphis, which would consume a lot of time period to deliver the Learned counsel lastly submits that the compensation awarded by the NCDRC is unjust and unfair and is based on the conjectures and We have heard learned counsel for the appellant as well as the respondents at length and perused the material placed on record meticulously.Initially, the NCDRC passed a final order on holding that there has been a short delivery of 104 pieces equal to 1822 Kgs.in view of Rule 22 of Carriage by Air Act, multiplying this weight by US 20 per Kg., the amount payable work out to US 36440 which becomes payable by the respondent to the complainant for the loss of goods.This amount was directed to be paid by the respondent along with interest 9 from In so far as the issue delay in delivering the the NCDRC found that in the absence of any communication emanating from the respondent No.1-Kuwait Airways promising to deliver the goods by any particular date, the plea raised by the complainant regarding delay in delivering the goods is not sustainable.Challenging the above order dated of the NCDRC, the complainant Civil Appeal bearing 8211 of 2003 which was allowed by this Court on This Court observed that the issue delay in delivery of goods has been by NCDRC without appreciating the material and on record.Resultantly, the matter was remitted back to NCDRC for fresh consideration of the complainant case vis--vis delay in delivering the After the remand, the present impugned order has been passed holding that there was delay in delivering the on time for which the complainant is entitled to compensation of 25037.5 Kg.multiplied by US 20 Kg.each which comes to US which the sum of Rs.20 lakhs claimed by the complainant the complainant was only entitled to have compensation of Rs.20 lakhs along with interest 9 31.07.1996 till its realization as also the charges and compensation for harassment and mental agony in the sum of Rs.5 lakhs.Basing on the material on record, the NCDRC has held that the fax message sent by respondent No.2-agent through whom the was booked to be shipped by the respondent No.1 goes to show that the goods shall be at Chicago Memphis on 31.07.1996 and However, when the did not reach the destination, appellant - M s Art Emporium informed the respondents the respondent no.2 provided a revised schedule, however, the shipments did not reach the destination even as per the revised schedule, according to which the goods were to reach the destination on The on record shows that the parts of the shipments were at Memphis on 30.08.1996 as admitted by the respondent No.1 in its letter dated Referring to the documents showing relation complainant and his buyer, the NCDRC would observe that the buyer was the largest customer of the complainant.Thus, the complainant has suffered huge loss due to transaction and the goods were in the first week of 1996.We have perused and examined the material on record and we are satisfied that the NCDRC has not committed any or perversity in recording the finding that there was delay in delivery of As a matter of fact, it is an admitted position that the which was booked on 24.07.1996, was after one and a half month i.e.from to In its reply before the NCDRC, the No.2 (Dagga Air Agents) admitted that at the time of booking, the complainant was informed about the date of arrival of goods at Memphis by 31.07.1996 and a revised schedule was also given to the complainant.Once the agent has issued a time schedule for delivery of it cannot be said that there is no material that there was no for delivery of the in time.respondent no.1 Kuwait Airways has never taken the stand in any of the communication arising from its office that the respondent No.2 is not its agents or that there was no or promise by its agent that the will be in 07 days.The NCDRC has rightly noted that the appellant has paid air freight which is ten times more than the sea freight only to ensure that the reaches its destination within a week because sea cargo would have taken 25 to 30 days for delivery and the appellant has paid such huge freight charges for ensuring early delivery, hence, the delay in delivery of has necessarily inflicted damage to the appellant which is liable to be satisfied by the respondent No.1 as provided under Section 19 and 13(3) of the Carriage by Air Act 1972.The provisions contained in Section 19 and 13 (3) of the Carriage by Air Act 1972 read as follows The is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of or goods.13 (3).If the admits the loss of the goods, or if the goods have not arrived at the expiration of seven days after the date on which they ought to have arrived, the consignee is entitled to put into force against the the rights which flow from the contract of carriage.By virtue of the above provisions, the consignee is entitled to seek damages for delay in delivering the It is not the case of the respondent No.1 that the respondent No.2 had acted beyond the terms of agency.Neither it is averred that the respondent no.2 was not the agent of respondent No.1.Section 186 of the Contract Act, 1872 provides that authority of an agent may be or implied.Similarly, Section 188 of the Contract Act, 1872 prescribes that an agent, having an authority to do an act, has authority to do every lawful thing which is necessary in order to do such act.In Dilawari Exporters v. Alitalia Cargo Ors.2 this Court has observed in 17 to 20 as follows - Section 186 of the Contract Act, 1872 (for short the Contract Act) lays down that the authority of an agent may be or implied.As per Section 187 of the Contract Act, an authority is said to be express when it is given by words spoken or written, and an authority is said to be implied when it is to be inferred from the of the case and things spoken or written, or the ordinary course of dealing, which may be accounted of the case.Section 188 of the Contract Act prescribes that Extent of agents authority.An agent, having an authority to do an act, has authority to do every lawful thing which is necessary in order to do such act.Section 237 of the Contract Act provides that of principal inducing belief that agents unauthorised acts were authorised.When an agent has, without authority, done acts or incurred obligations to third persons on behalf of his principal, the principal is bound by such acts or obligations if he has by his words or conduct induced such third persons to that such acts and 2 (2010) 5 SCC 754 obligations were within the scope of the agents authority.There is no gainsaying that onus to show that the act done by an agent was within the scope of his authority or ostensible authority held or by him is on the person claiming against the principal.This, of course, can be shown by practice as well as by a written instrument.Thus, the question for consideration is whether on the obtaining in the instant case, can it be said that Respondent 3 had an express or implied authority to act on behalf of Respondent 1 as their agent?If Respondent 3 had such an authority, then obviously Respondent 1 was bound by the Respondent 3 had made to the appellant.In the case at hand, in the absence of a plea by the respondent No.1, that the respondent no.2 was not its agent or that he had no authority to give schedule of delivery of the onus has not been discharged.the respondent No.1 is bound by the promise held by its agent - respondent No.2, that the goods shall be within one week and when the time schedule expired and the goods were, in fact, after one and a half month, there was negligent delay in delivery of The grievance of the appellant in this appeal is mainly on account of the NCDRC not allowing the entire claim for compensation by calculating the total weight of the subject at 2507.5 Kg.multiplied by US 20 per Kg.According to the appellant, in view of Rule 22 (2) of of the Carriage by Air Act, 1972 (as amended by the Hague the amount thus calculated would the sum of Rs.20 lakhs.The appellant would thus claim the entire amount equivalent to US without it to Rs.20 lakhs.However, on this point also, we approve and sustain the order passed by the NCDRC for the reason that in its complaint under Section 21(a)(i) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the complainant appellant has sought damages for Rs.20 lakhs only as compensation for loss of and reputation.It is a trite law that a party is not entitled to seek relief which he has not prayed for.For this we may profitably refer to this Courts judgments in Trojan Co.Vs.

Supreme_Court_2022_34,"M. Sundresh, J.The application for of delay in filing the application for restoration as well as the application for restoration are allowed in Criminal Appeal No.700 of 2011.Conviction and by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Bench at Gwalior, confirming the life imprisonment by the 2nd Additional Judge, Shivpuri, while modifying a similar to that of seven years, is under Signature Not Verified challenge before us.Digitally signed by Deepak Singh Date 175808 IST Reason THE CASE AS UNFOLDED THROUGH THE PROSECUTIONS EYES IS The appellants, along with his group of men, and the were having prior enmity.It arose pursuant to a water dispute, as the appellants and the villagers did not appreciate entry into their village facilitated by the purchase of properties by the The took place on 25.07.1992 at about a.m.The first information was recorded by P.W.20, the Police Officer, who also conducted the from one of the Hukum Singh, who subsequently died on Under Ex.P-28, Dehati Nalishi, which was recorded as the first information report, the Hukum Singh made a about the prior incident.The Dehati Nalishi further to state that when he along with the other Kishori Kachi and the eye witness P.W.12, Hakim Singh, went out to attend the natures call, the accused persons armed with weapons, including truncheon and axe, attacked them In pursuance of the said common objective, all three of them were taken by the attackers to their place, as witnessed by their family members and relatives.This was done despite the request made by one Bhogiram and Bhaggo Bai, They were also attacked, but Bhogiram was dumped on the way.The family members of the Hukum Singh, inclusive of his daughters-in-law, daughters, Bacchu (P.W.13) and Sirnam Kachi were not present at the place of during the time of the offence.Complaint could not be lodged as the Hukum Singh was not allowed to leave, while Kishori died.The made by the Hukum Singh was recorded by P.W.20 at the place of He died subsequently on 28.07.1992, after three days in the hospital.It is to be noted that no was made to record the either before the Magistrate or in the of a doctor.On a perusal of the records, we find that the thumb impression of the was affixed in the middle of Dehati Nalishi, and words have been written over it, thus giving an impression that it was an The appellants namely, Sardar Singh and Dhola Ram, were convicted along with the other accused for the offences punishable under Sections 148, 302/149 and 324/149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 to as IPC), by the Trial Court for committing the murder of two persons.However, the High Court, while confirming the life imprisonment for the death of the Kishori Kachi, modified the same qua the Hukum Singh, to one punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC.Three of the accused convicted by the Trial Court died during the pendency of the present proceedings, while five of them had completed their and were The appellants have undergone incarceration for a period of nine years.Before the Trial Court, the prosecution examined 21 out of which 6 of them were eye One eye witness, Bhogiram, died during the pendency of the proceedings, and hence not examined as a witness.We now proceed to the depositions of the prosecution W.1 This witness is the wife of the Hukum Singh.She the accused persons only in the Court.Admittedly, no test parade was done.Her deposition was recorded three years after the incident.Though, she asserted that she was an eye witness, it was obviously contrary to the Dehati Nalishi of the Hukum Singh.In her deposition, she has also stated that there were others who egged on the accused persons to continue with the assault.It was her that the accused carried both the and Bhogiram to their place.A further deposition has been given that she was not told about the names of the accused, and she did not know any of them by name.It is her further that the accused persons present in the Court cannot be named.She admits that there are number of contradictions the made by her under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to as CrPC) and her deposition.One of her is to the effect that the village watchman was present, but he was also from reporting the incident to the police.Both the and Bhogiram were in a state of At the time of the assault, about 60 to 70 persons belonging to the group of the accused were present.P.W.1 has made a categorical that P.W.13, Bacchu, along with others went during the nighttime to report the incident to the police personnel.He brought them back to the place of Of course, she retracted the to the effect that it is not correct to state that all the five victims were in a state of and they gave their except Kishori.W.4 Even this witness has the accused by their faces only in the Court as she did not know their names.She could not even identify one of the accused whom she was asked to identify.Like P.W.1, her was also not recorded by the Hukum Singh.Claiming to be an eye witness, she narrated the incident.She also improved the prosecution version by placing certain facts which were not However, she has stated that the was found lying at the door of the accused when the police party came.A has been made to the effect that both the and the injured were lying unconscious.She has clearly stated that the police party arrived 6.00 to 7.00 a.m. on The above deposition of P.W.4 is contrary to the very case projected by the prosecution starting from the alleged dying declaration of the Hukum Singh.W.12 This witness is the eye witness even as per the Dehati Nalishi.He is also an injured witness.Strangely, he has not lodged any report of the incident, though his is stated to be recorded as per the prosecution version.He has stated on more than one occasion that his was not recorded by the police, and that he has come to depose in the court for the first time.He had also not narrated the incident to anybody from the date of the incident till his deposition.This witness again makes a clear that on the date of incident there were about 50 to 100 persons on the side of the accused.All of them were involved in the incident of assault.He could not clearly identify any of them, while a specific overt act amongst the aforesaid persons.The entire crowd attacked the He did not tell the police that the named accused, tried to assault him.It is interesting to note that this witness did not speak about the of the other reportedly he had seen the from a distance of one furlong, which is about 200 meters.From the aforesaid narration, one cannot rely on the recorded from P.W.12, as is the case of the other two It is also apparent that even this witness speaks about the of scores of others, gathered to assault the W.13 This witness also claims to be an eye witness to the According to him, he hid himself when the happened.he went to the police station, met the of Police, and lodged a complaint.He is also a witness to the site plan, Ex.P-16 and the arrest memo, Ex.P-19.Even during his he deposed that he returned with the police personnel to the place of around 3.00 to 4.00 p.m., which is again a to the case of the prosecution.In his cross-examination, he admits that what he deposed in its entirety was not found in his under Section 161 CrPC recorded as Ex.D- He met the Station Officer as directed by the of Police.It is his specific case that the was recorded at the police station.This witness found both the and the injured witness in an unconscious state when the police party reached the place of The of the injured witness, and the were recorded in the hospital at 5.00 p.m. to state that the of this witness strikes at the very foundation of the prosecutions version.With his there are three first information reports.W.18 P.W.18 is the wife of one of the Kishori.Like others, she also claims to be an eye witness.After the she went to the police station and lodged the first information report by affixing her thumb impression.She was accompanied by three persons, including her brother-in-law.She also did not know the accused by name.Once again, the aforesaid the factum of multiple first information reports given at different times leading to the conclusion that it would not be to place reliance on the official one.W.20 The officer is arrayed as His role as it is he who recorded the Dehati Nalishi from the and converted it into a first information report.He puts up a totally different version.In the he says that he a phone call from an person.He has also recorded the of the Hukum Singh in the hospital, but no one knows about its fate.Though he had stated that he also recorded the of P.W.12 (Hakim Singh), it was not done, as rightly deposed by the said person who was made to depose for the first time only before the Court.Contrary to the first information report, he has stated that the members of the victims family were also present.Though, he has recorded the of Hukum Singh, P.W.12 (Hakim Singh), Bhogiram and P.W.18 (Bhaggo Bai), he did not mention the date and time, except with respect to the of the Hukum Singh, which appears to be rather strange, giving to the that either they have been recorded at a different point of time or that there was no from Hukum Singh.He once again contradicted himself by stating that he did not record the of Hukum Singh on the spot, while acknowledging that the of W.12 (Hakim Singh) and Bhogiram were not taken by him.A further has been given that he was given a verbal order.As an Investigating Officer, this witness was to tell the truth.Though a report of the officer would an opinion, the very case of the prosecution that it is he who recorded the of the taken in the form of the first information report creates a very serious doubt.It is apparent that his is not only contradictory, but also destructive.Having the on record, we shall now consider the approach of the Trial Court and the High Court.DECISIONS OF THE COURTS Both the Courts below have relied upon the prosecution heavily.The depositions of the eye found favour with the Courts.Much reliance was also placed on the by the in the Dehati Nalishi.The contradictions pointed out were not taken due note of.The of the were with each other with respect to the Having found that there were two homicidal deaths, a final conclusion was arrived at by holding the appellants guilty.OF THE APPELLANTS The learned counsel appearing for the appellants, placing reliance on the written arguments given, submitted that there are three different first information reports as per the prosecution version.The discrepancies in the of the prosecution are either self-contradictory or against each other.No witness has spoken about recording of Dehati Nalishi, as deposed by The condition of the Hukum Singh was unconscious.The language used in Ex.P-28 indicates that of a trained mind.The thumb impression of the Hukum Singh was not proved, and its placement creates a serious doubt.W.20 contradicts himself on various counts.He did not disclose the name of the person who furnished the information.The earlier version of this report was on purpose.There is absolutely no explanation for not examining P.W.12, who even under Ex.P-28 was shown as an eye witness.There were about more than 50 to 100 persons present and involved.The charge under Section 149 IPC is not made out as there was no explanation for not including the scores of other persons.To the aforesaid the Learned Counsel has placed reliance on the following decisions of this Court Charan Singh and Others v. State of U.P., (2004) 4 SCC 205 Desurbhai Wagh v. Deganbhai Vagh and Others, (2017) 3 SCC 261 Balmukund Sharma v. State of Bihar, (2019) 5 SCC 469 Vyas Ram v.

State of 2005 SCC (Cri) 1050 (2005) 5 SCC 272 OF THE RESPONDENT The Learned counsel appearing for the State while acknowledging the fact that there were reportedly three first information reports, submitted that two injured have spoken about the of whom one was the author of the first information report.The contradictions are minor in nature, and to be The Hukum Singh has made a before P.W.20, which has to be treated as a dying declaration.Both the Courts below concurrently found that the appellants committed the offence, and the need not be re- appreciated by this Court.Investigating Officers Role We have already dealt with the given by the prosecution To sum it up, we find the speak about three first information reports.Even on the recording of the of the Hukum Singh, P.W.20, the Investigating Officer was not very clear.The discrepancy also extends to the place where the body was found when the was recorded.An officer is to act in an un-biased, fair and in a manner that is required of a public servant.His concern is to find out the truth.The of the given by the other would obviously go to the root of the matter.One does not know the clear picture, and the benefit shall be to the appellants.We wish to place reliance on the decision of this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh Ratan Singh and Others, (2020) 12 SCC 630 As emphasised by this Court in Amitbhai Anil Chandra Shah v. CBI, (2013) 6 SCC 348 (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 309, only the earliest or the first information in regard to the commission of a cognizable offence the of Section 154, and consequently there cannot be a second FIR.Rather it is absurd or ridiculous to call such information as second FIR.In v. State of T.N., (2009) 14 SCC 415 (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 1392, this Court observed that if an FIR is filed after recording the of the such second information would be in Moreover, in Nallabothu Ramulu v. State of A.P., (2014) 12 SCC 261 (2014) 6 SCC (cri) 673, the Court was of the view that the non- of of injured as the first information cast doubt on the prosecution version.Thus, not only was there a delay in filing of the FIR (which remained unexplained) which was taken as the basis of the in this case, but also there was a wilful of the actual first information by the police.These factors together cast grave doubts on the of the prosecution version, and lead us to the conclusion that there has been an to build up a different case for the prosecution and bring in as many persons as accused as possible.Additionally, the so-called eye to the incident have described different places as the scene of offence.None of the eye are consistent so far as the scene of offence is concerned.This means that each of the eye witness must have seen the incident at different places and happening in a different manner.The of the actual FIR, coupled with the conflicting versions of the so-called eye relating to different scenes of offence and different stories would reveal that the prosecution wanted to and has the real incident and culpability of real culprits.The origin and genesis of the prosecution is clearly in the case.In Arvind Kumar Nemichand v. State of 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1099 2021(14) SCALE 6, Fair, Colourable Investigation An Investigating Officer being a public servant is to conduct the fairly.While doing so, he is to look for materials for coming to a correct conclusion.He is concerned with the offense as against an offender.It is the offense that he investigates.a homicide happens, an officer is to cover all the aspects and, in the process, shall always keep in mind as to whether the offence would come under Section 299 IPC sans Section 300 IPC.In other words, it is his primary duty to satisfy that a case would fall under culpable homicide not amounting to murder and then a murder.When there are adequate materials he shall not be overzealous in preparing a case for an offense punishable under Section 302 IPC.We that a pliable change is required in the mind of the Investigating Officer.After all, such an officer is an officer of the court also and his duty is to find out the truth and help the court in coming to the correct conclusion.He does not know sides, either of the victim or the accused but shall only be guided by law and be an epitome of fairness in his There is a subtle a and one brought forth by a calculated and action or inaction.A per se would not enure to the benefit of the accused, unless it goes into the root of the very case of the prosecution being fundamental in nature.While dealing with a a court of law is to sift the and find out the truth on the principle that every case involves a journey towards truth.There shall not be any pedantic approach either by the prosecution or by the court as a case involves an of law rather than morality.We would only the aforesaid principle qua a fair through the following judgment of Kumar v. State, (2018) 7 SCC 536 The action of authority in pursuing the case in the manner in which they have done must be rebuked.The High Court on this aspect, correctly notices that the police authorities have botched up the arrest for reasons best known to them.Although we are aware of the ratio laid down in Parbhu v. King Emperor Parbhu King Emperor, AIR 1944 PC 73, wherein the Court had ruled that and of arrest would not affect the culpability of the offence if the same is proved by cogent yet in this case at hand, such should be shown as the authorities are responsible for of facts.The criminal justice must be above reproach.It is irrelevant whether the falsity lie in the of or the guilt of the accused.The authority has a to investigate in a fair manner and elicit truth.At the cost of repetition, I must remind the authorities concerned to take up the in a neutral manner, without having regard to the ultimate result.In this case at hand, we cannot close our eyes to what has happened regardless of guilt or the asserted of the the aspect wherein the police has actively connived to the facts, cannot be ignored or A fair would become a colourable one when there involves a Suppressing the motive, injuries and other existing factors which will have the effect of modifying or altering the charge would amount to a perfunctory and, become a false narrative.If the courts find that the foundation of the prosecution case is false and would not conform to the doctrine of fairness as against a conscious then the very case of the prosecution falls to the ground unless there are unimpeachable to come to a conclusion for awarding a punishment on a different charge.Falsus In Uno-Falsus in Omnibus The principle that when a witness deposes falsehood, the in its entirety has to be may not have strict application to the criminal jurisprudence in our country.The principle governing sifting the chaff from the grain has to be applied.However, when the is inseparable and such an would either be impossible or would make the unacceptable, the natural would be one of avoidance.The said principle has not assumed the status of law but continues only as a rule of caution.One has to see the nature of discrepancy in a given case.When the discrepancies are very material shaking the very of the witness leading to a conclusion in the mind of the court that it is neither possible to separate it nor to rely upon, it is for the said court to either accept or reject.The said principle of law has been dealt with by this court in Anand Chougule v. Sidarai Laxman Chougala, (2019) 8 SCC 50, which states thus We have considered the and perused the materials on record.The relationship parties and the of a land dispute regarding which a civil suit was also pending are undisputed facts.The fact that a verbal duel followed by scuffle took place the parties culminating in injuries is a concurrent finding of fact by two courts.The fact that the accused also lodged an FIR with regard to the same stands established by the of PWs 19 and 22, the officers, who have admitted that the had also lodged BRPS Cr.No.79/02 marked Ext.D-10, which was not investigated by them.Similarly, PW 11, the police constable, deposed that two of the accused were admitted in the District Hospital, Belgaum and that he was posted on watch duty.The is of 7-6-2002 and 1 and 2 were discharged on 11-6-2002.Their injury report has not been brought on record by the prosecution and no explanation has been furnished in that regard.The burden lies on the prosecution to prove the allegations beyond all reasonable doubt.In to the same, the accused has only to create a doubt about the prosecution case and the probability of its An accused is not required to establish or prove his beyond all reasonable doubt, unlike the prosecution.If the accused takes a which is not improbable and appears likely, there is material in support of such the accused is not required to prove anything further.The benefit of doubt must follow unless the prosecution is able to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt.P.W.20 is the one who recorded the On the made, it is highly doubtful as to whether the would be conscious enough to give the particularly in light of the injuries suffered by him.There are not only incise wounds, but there must have also been continuous bleeding, which would have naturally occurred, as the case was a day after the The of contradicts each other on this aspect.as rightly submitted by the counsel for the appellants, on a perusal of the records, we do find that there were writings over the thumb impression made under Ex.P-28.It is rather strange as a thumb impression would normally follow the it has to find place at the conclusion of the We find, on our scrutiny, that even after the thumb impression over which there were obviously writings found, there were some more written.This obviously lends to the view that thumb impression must have been obtained on a blank paper and in a hurry, the contents were filled up subsequently.From the above analysis, we are not inclined to treat the so-called as the one actually given by the to In any case, it cannot be taken as a dying declaration, particularly in the light of the by the other prosecution We do find force in the made by the counsel for appellants that Ex.P-28 does appear to be created by a trained mind.The Hukum Singh merely knows how to put a signature, leave alone the fact that he put his thumb impression, which could have been possible because of the injuries suffered by him.A reading of the would clearly show that a legal mind was at work, as the may not know the a common object and common The also excludes others specifically for reasons which we do not know.The excluded persons were shown as by the same officer.Dying Declaration There is absolutely no explanation given by P.W.20 as to why he has not utilized the services of either a Magistrate or a doctor, even after his first recording.We have already the fact that he deposed that the was recorded once again which, however, was not a part of the record.If the Hukum Singh was so badly injured, and died within few days of his admission into the hospital, nothing P.W.20 to record the in the of a Judicial Magistrate and duly certified by the doctor.The conclusion which we have arrived at already, is that the was not in a state of fit enough to make a and that is the reason why the thumb impression was obtained subsequently, and a was created.On the issue of recording of dying declarations by the officer, we would like to the decision of this Court in Munnu Raja and Another v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (1976) 3 SCC 104 We might, however, mention before we close that the High Court ought not to have placed any reliance on the third dying declaration, Ex.P-2, which is said to have been made by the in the hospital.The officer who recorded that the had undoubtedly taken the precaution of keeping a doctor present and it appears that some of the friends and relations of the were also present at the time when the was recorded.But, if the officer thought that Bahadur Singh was in a precarious condition, he ought to have the services of a magistrate for recording the dying declaration.Investigating officers are naturally in the of the and the practice of the officer himself recording a dying declaration during the course of ought not to be encouraged.We have excluded from our consideration the dying declaration, Ex.P-2, recorded in the hospital.This Court in State of Jharkhand v. Shailendra Kumar Rai SCC OnLine SC 1494 There is no rule to the effect that a dying declaration is when it is recorded by a police officer instead of a Magistrate.Although a dying declaration ought to ideally be recorded by a Magistrate if possible, it cannot be said that dying declarations recorded by police personnel are for that reason alone.The issue of whether a dying declaration recorded by the police is admissible must be after considering the facts and of each case.Test Parade Having found that Ex.P-28 cannot be we are inclined to hold that the by the prosecution through the eye also is not The are not able to name the accused over which we do not wish to say anything.However, they have the accused, only after 2 to 3 years for the first time in the Court.We are quite conscious about the evidentiary value of a test parade.Certainly, in a case of this nature, it ought to have been done.Though a test parade is not a substantive piece of at times, it adds strength to the case of the prosecution by giving more to the of the eye which we find as grossly lacking.This Court in Gireesan Nair and Others v. State of Kerala, (2023) 1 SCC 180, held We may, at the outset, note that the questioned by the prosecution did not give out the names or of the accused in the riot and involved in the destruction of public property.the IO (PW 84) had to necessarily conduct a TIP.The object of conducting a TIP is threefold.First, to enable the to satisfy that the accused whom they suspect is really the one who was seen by them in with the crime.Second, to satisfy the authorities that the suspect is the real person whom the had seen in with the said Third, to test the memory based on first impression and enable the prosecution to decide whether all or any of them could be cited as to the crime (Mulla v. State of U.P.Mulla v. State of U.P., (2010) 3 SCC 508, paras 44, 45 55 (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 1150 ).TIPs belong to the stage of by the police.It that is proceeding in the right direction.It is a rule of prudence which is required to be followed in cases where the accused is not known to the witness or the complainant (Matru v. State of U.P.Matru v. State of P., (1971) 2 SCC 75, para 17 1971 SCC (Cri) 391 Mulla v. State of P. Mulla v. State of U.P., (2010) 3 SCC 508, paras 41 43 (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 1150 and C. Muniappan v. State of T.N.C. Muniappan v. State of T.N., (2010) 9 SCC 567, para 42 (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 1402 ).The of a TIP is admissible under Section 9 of the Evidence Act.However, it is not a substantive piece of Instead, it is used to the given by before a court of law at the time of trial.TIPs, even if held, cannot be considered in all the cases as on which the conviction of an accused can be sustained (State of H.P.v. Lekh Raj State of H.P.v. Lekh Raj, 1 SCC 247, para 3 SCC (Cri) 147 and C. Muniappan v. State of T.N.Muniappan v. State of T.N., (2010) 9 SCC 567, para 42 (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 1402 ).It is a matter of great importance both for the agency and for the accused and a fortiori for the proper of justice that a TIP is held without avoidable and unreasonable delay after the arrest of the accused.This becomes necessary to eliminate the of the accused being shown to the before the test parade.This is a very common plea of the accused, and the prosecution has to be cautious to ensure that there is no scope for making such an allegation.If, however, are beyond control and there is some delay, it cannot be said to be fatal to the prosecution.But reasons should be given as to why there was a delay (Mulla v. State of U.P.Mulla v. State of U.P., (2010) 3 SCC 508, para 45 (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 1150 and Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State of Bihar Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State of Bihar, 1995 Supp SCC 80 1995 SCC (Cri) 60).Section 149 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 The clearly speak about the of a large group of persons belonging to the side of the accused.In fact, the is to the effect that they also participated in the In a case involving the of Section 149 IPC, a little more scrutiny is required on the part of the Court as there may be a tendency to implicate persons along with the actual accused who committed the offence.The Courts will have to be very while sifting through the in such cases.In the case on hand, we find that it would be unsafe to implicate the accused persons under Section 149 IPC which obviously deals with an of vicarious as held by this Court in Arvind Kumar (supra), Scope of Section 149 Section 149 of the Code deals with a common object.To this provision there must be of an assembly with the common object becoming an unlawful one.The concept of constructive or vicarious is brought into this provision by making the offense committed by one member of the unlawful assembly to the others having the common object.It is the sharing of the common object which the offense committed by one to the other members.the mere in an assembly per se would not an offense, it does become one when the assembly is unlawful.It is the common object to commit an offense which results in the said offense being committed.though it is committed by one, a deeming fiction is created by making it applicable to the others as well due to the commonality in their objective to commit an offense.Thus, it is for the prosecution to prove the factors such as the of the assembly with a requisite number, the common object for the object being unlawful, and an offense committed by one such member.Courts will have to be more and cautious while dealing with a case of accused charged under Section 149 IPC, as it involves a deeming fiction.a higher of onus is required to be put on the prosecution to prove that a person charged with an offense is liable to be punished for the offence committed by the others under section 149 IPC.The principle governing the aforesaid aspect is taken note of by this court in Ranjit Singh v. State of Punjab, (2013) 16 SCC 752 Baladin v. State of U.P.AIR 1956 SC 181 1956 Cri LJ 345 was one of the early cases in which this Court dealt with Section 149 IPC.This Court held that mere in an assembly does not make a person a member of the unlawful assembly, unless it is shown that he had done or omitted to do something which would show that he was a member of the unlawful assembly or unless the case fell under Section 142 IPC.Resultantly, if all the members of a family and other residents of the village assembled at the place of all such persons could not be condemned ipso facto as members of the unlawful assembly.The prosecution in all such cases shall have to lead to show that a particular accused had done some overt act to establish that he was a member of the unlawful assembly.This would require the case of each to be examined so that mere spectators who had just joined the assembly and who were unaware of its motive may not be branded as members of the unlawful assembly.The observations made in Baladin case AIR 1956 SC 181 1956 Cri LJ 345 were considered in Masalti v. State of U.P.AIR 1965 SC 202 (1965) 1 Cri LJ 226 where this Court explained that cases in which persons who are merely passive and had joined the assembly out of curiosity, without sharing the common object of the assembly stood on a different footing otherwise it was not necessary to prove that the person had committed some act or was guilty of some omission in pursuance of the common object of the assembly before he could be fastened with the of an act committed by any other member of the assembly with the help of Section 149 IPC.The following passage is apposite in this regard (Masalti case AIR 1965 SC 202 (1965) 1 Cri LJ 226, AIR p. 211, para 17) The crucial question to in such a case is whether the assembly consisted of five or more persons and whether the said persons one or more of the common objects as specified by Section 141.While determining this question, it becomes relevant to consider whether the assembly consisted of some persons who were merely passive and had",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
joined the assembly as a matter of idle curiosity without to entertain the common object of the assembly.It is in that context that the observations made by this Court in Baladin AIR 1956 SC 181 1956 Cri LJ 345 assume otherwise, in law, it would not be correct to say that before a person is held to be a member of an unlawful assembly, it must be shown that he had committed some overt act or had been guilty of some omission in pursuance of the common object of the assembly.In fact, Section 149 makes it clear that if an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time of the committing of that offence, is a member of the same assembly, is guilty of that offence and that emphatically brings out the principle that the punishment prescribed by Section 149 is in a sense vicarious and does not always proceed on the basis that the offence has been actually committed by every member of the unlawful assembly.(emphasis supplied) Again in Bajwa v. State of U.P.(1973) 1 SCC 714 this Court held that while in a faction-ridden society there is always a tendency to implicate even the with the guilty, the only safeguard against the risk of the with the guilty lies in upon acceptable which in some measure implicates the accused and the of the court.That in a faction-ridden village community, there is a tendency to implicate also along with the guilty, especially when a large number of are involved in the commission of an offence is a matter of common knowledge.Evidence in such cases is bound to be partisan, but while the courts cannot take an easy route to rejecting out of hand such only on that ground, what ought to be done is to approach the depositions carefully and scrutinise the more closely to avoid any miscarriage of justice.This Court in Binay Kumar Singh v. State of Bihar, (1997) 1 SCC 283, observed that There is no rule of that no conviction can be based unless a certain number of have a particular accused as a member of the unlawful assembly.It is axiomatic that is not to be counted but only weighed and it is not the quantity of but the quality that matters.Even the testimony of one single witness, if wholly reliable, is sufficient to establish the of an accused as a member of an unlawful assembly.All the same, when the size of the unlawful assembly is quite large (as in this case) and many persons would have witnessed the incident, it would be a prudent to insist on at least two reliable to vouchsafe the of an accused as a participant in the rioting.In Masalti v. State of U.P.AIR 1965 SC 202 (1964) 8 SCR 133 a Bench of four Judges of this Court has adopted such a formula.It is useful to extract it here where a criminal court has to deal with pertaining to the commission of an offence involving a large number of offenders and a large number of victims, it is usual to adopt the test that the conviction could be sustained only if it is supported by two or three or more who give a consistent account of the incident.Testimony of the Eye Witness Much reliance has been placed on the of There is no difficulty in appreciating the that an injured witness has to be placed on a higher pedestal.However, P.W.12 has not been examined by P.W.20 at all.In his deposition, P.W.12 makes this position clear.The of P.W.12 under Section 161 CrPC, if recorded, has also not been marked.Even P.W.20 at one stage acknowledges the said fact, though with some contradictions.This again brings us to the conclusion that it would be unsafe to rely upon the of P.W.12, who once again the accused for the first time before the Court.There is absolutely no explanation for not examining him during the Thus, we find that the of P.W.12 cannot be relied upon, particularly in the light of the charges under Section 149 IPC, and insofar as the appellants are concerned.Having found the above contradictions, we have no other option except to allow these appeals.We find that both the Trial Court and the High Court did not apply their mind to the various aspects, as we above.In such view of the matter," we are constrained to set aside the aforesaid judgments by conferring the benefit of doubt to the appellants.""",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

State of U.P.1 can always be adopted by the High Court.The High Court has a discretion to appoint an advocate to espouse the cause of the appellant when the advocate appointed by the appellant refuses to argue the appeal on unreasonable grounds.Though the High Court has an option of considering the merits of the appeal and deciding the same on merits, the High Court could always adopt the first course of appointing an advocate to espouse the cause of the appellant.1.(1996) 4 SCC 720 Criminal Appeal SLP(Crl.)No.8609/2023 Page 2 of 5 Sub-section 1 of Section 389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short CrPC) reads thus Suspension of pending the appeal of appellant on bail - (1) Pending any appeal by a convicted person, the Appellate Court may, for reasons to be recorded by it in writing, order that the execution of the or order appealed against be suspended and, also, if he is in that he be on bail, or on his own bond.Provided that the Appellate Court shall, before releasing on bail or on his own bond a convicted person who is convicted of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years, shall give opportunity to the Public Prosecutor for showing cause in writing against such Provided further that in cases where a convicted person is on bail it shall be open to the Public Prosecutor to file an application for the cancellation of the bail.(underline supplied) Under sub-section 1 of Section 389, while suspending the of the who is in Jail, the Appellate Court has to enlarge the accused on bail till the final disposal of the appeal.The Criminal Appeal SLP(Crl.)No.8609/2023 Page 3 of 5 second proviso to sub-section 1 of Section 389 permits the Public Prosecutor to file an application for cancellation of the bail granted under sub-section 1.The second proviso to sub-section 1 of Section 389 is on par with sub-section 2 of Section 439 of CrPC.the Court can even Suo Motu issue a notice calling upon the accused to show cause why the bail should not be cancelled.Under no the bail granted to an accused under sub-section 1 of Section 389 can be cancelled without giving a reasonable opportunity to the accused of being heard.Unfortunately, the High Court, without even giving an opportunity of being heard to the on the issue of cancellation of bail, has straight away to cancel the bail granted to him.Such approach on the part of the High Court cannot be especially when the High Court can always deal with the situation when an adjournment is sought by the advocate for the accused at the time of final hearing of the appeal on unreasonable grounds.For the default of the advocate appointed by the accused, the Appellate Court cannot penalize the accused by proceeding to cancel his bail only on the ground that his advocate has sought adjournment and that also without giving an opportunity Criminal Appeal SLP(Crl.)No.8609/2023 Page 4 of 5 of being heard to him on the issue of cancellation of bail.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2013) 5 SCC 470, it is observed and held by this Court that a party cannot claim anything more than what is covered by the terms of the contract, for the reason that the contract is a transaction two parties and has been into with open eyes and by the nature of contract.It is further observed that thus the contract being a creature of an two or more parties has to be giving literal meanings unless there is some ambiguity therein.The contract is to be giving the actual meaning to the words contained in the contract and it is not permissible for the Court to make a new contract, however reasonable, if the parties have not made it It is further observed that the terms of the contract have to be construed strictly without altering the nature of a contract as it may affect the interest of either of the parties adversely (Para 23).6.4 In the case of Harsha Construction Vs. Union of India and Ors.(2014) 9 SCC 246, it is observed and held by this Court in 18 and 19 as under Arbitration arises from a contract and unless there is a specific written contract, a contract with regard to arbitration cannot be presumed.Section 7(3) of the Act clearly specifies that the contract with regard to arbitration must be in writing.Thus, so far as the disputes which have been to in Clause 39 of the contract are concerned, it was not open to the to arbitrate upon the said disputes as there was a specific clause whereby the said disputes had been Moreover, when the law specifically makes a provision with regard to formation of a contract in a particular manner, there cannot be any presumption with regard to a contract if the contract is not into by the mode prescribed under the Act.If a nonarbitrable dispute is to an and even if an issue is framed by the in relation to such a dispute, in our opinion, there cannot be a presumption or a conclusion to the effect that the parties had agreed to refer the issue to the In the instant case, the respondent authorities had raised an objection relating to the of the aforestated issue before the and yet the had his decision on the said dispute.In our opinion, the could not have the said dispute.We, hold that it was not open to the to decide the which were not arbitrable and the award, so far as it relates to disputes regarding nonarbitrable disputes is concerned, is bad in law and is hereby quashed.6.5 In the recent decision in the case of Vidya Drolia (supra), which, as such, is postinsertion of Section 11(6A) of the Arbitration Act, it is observed and held that the issue of of a dispute is basic for arbitration as it relates to the very of the Arbitral Tribunal.An Arbitral Tribunal may lack for several reasons and has multiple meanings.After to another decision of this Court in the case of Booz Allen Hamiltan Inc.Vs. SBI Home Finance Ltd. (2011) 5 SCC 532 (Para 34), it is observed and held that there are facets of namely Whether the disputes are capable of adjudication and by arbitration?That is, whether the disputes, having regard to their nature, could be resolved by a private forum chosen by the parties (the Arbitral Tribunal) or whether they would exclusively fall within the domain of public fora (courts).Whether the disputes are covered by the arbitration That is, whether the disputes are or described in the arbitration as matters to be by arbitration or whether the disputes fall under the matters excluded from the purview of the arbitration Whether the parties have the disputes to arbitration?That is, whether the disputes fall under the scope of the to the Arbitral Tribunal, or whether they do not arise out of the of claim and the counterclaim filed before the Arbitral Tribunal.A dispute, even if it is capable of being by arbitration and falling within the scope of an arbitration will not be arbitrable if it is not in the joint list of disputes to arbitration, or in the absence of such a joint list of disputes, does not form part of the disputes raised in the pleadings before the Arbitral Tribunal.6.6 After to and considering in detail the earlier decisions on the point, more particularly, with respect to and the matters, it is ultimately concluded in para 76 as under In view of the above we would like to propound a fourfold test for determining when the subject matter of a dispute in an arbitration is not arbitrable 76.1.(1) When cause of action and of the dispute relates to actions in rem, that do not pertain to subordinate rights in personam that arise from rights in rem.76.2.(2) When cause of action and of the dispute affects thirdparty rights have erga omnes effect require centralized adjudication, and mutual adjudication would not be and 76.3.(3) When cause of action and of the dispute relates to inalienable sovereign and public interest functions of the State and hence mutual adjudication would be 76.4 (4) When the of the dispute is expressly or by necessary nonarbitrable as per mandatory 76.5 These tests are not compartments they dovetail and overlap, albeit when applied and will help and in determining and ascertaining with great of certainty when as per law in India, a dispute or subject matter is nonarbitrable.Only when the answer is affirmative that the subject matter of the dispute would be nonarbitrable.76.6 However, the aforesaid principles have to be applied with care and caution as observed in Olympus (P) Ltd.Vs. Meena Vijay Khetan and Ors.5 SCC 651 (SCC p. 669, para 35) is made there to certain disputes like criminal offences of a public nature, disputes arising out of and disputes relating to status, such as divorce, which cannot be to arbitration.It has, however, been held that if in respect of facts relating to a criminal matter, say, physical injury, if there is a right to damages for personal injury, then such a dispute can be to arbitration (Keir v. Leeman).Similarly, it has been held that a husband and a wife may refer to arbitration the terms on which they shall separate, because they can make a valid on that matter (Soilleux v. Herbst, Wilson v. Wilson and Cahill v. Cahill).6.7 On the question, who decides on of the dispute, after to and considering the earlier decisions on the point, more particularly, the decisions in the cases of Garware Wall Ropes Ltd.Vs. Coastal Marine Constructions Engg.(2019) 9 SCC 209 United India Insurance Co. Ltd.Vs. Hyundai Engg.Construction Co. Ltd. (2018) 17 SCC 607, and Narbheram Power Steel (P) Ltd. (supra), it is observed and held that the question of relating to the inquiry, whether the dispute was governed by the arbitration clause, can be examined by the Courts at the stage itself and may not be left unanswered, to be examined and by the Arbitral Tribunal.in para 153, it is observed and held that the expression, of arbitration in Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, would include aspect of validity of an arbitration albeit the Court at the stage would apply the prima facie test.It is further observed that in cases of debatable and disputable facts and, good reasonably arguable case etc., the Court would force the parties to abide by the arbitration as the Arbitral Tribunal has the primary and authority to decide the disputes including the question of and Ultimately in para 154, the of law is crystallized as under under the heading Who decides can be crystallized as under 154.1.Ratio of the decision in Patel Ltd. on the scope of judicial review by the court while deciding an application under Sections 8 or 11 of the Arbitration Act, post the amendments by Act 3 of 2016 (with effect from 23102015) and even post the amendments vide Act 33 of 2019 (with effect from 982019), is no longer applicable.154.2.Scope of judicial review and of the court under Section 8 and 11 of the Arbitration Act is identical but limited and restricted.154.3.The general rule and principle, in view of the legislative mandate clear from Act 3 of 2016 and Act 33 of 2019, and the principle of severability and is that the arbitral tribunal is the first authority to and decide all questions of non The court has been conferred power of second look on aspects of post the award in terms of (i), (ii) or (iv) of Section 34(2)(a) or subclause of Section 34(2)(b) of the Arbitration Act.154.3.Rarely as a the court may at the Section 8 or 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie certain that the arbitration is invalid or the disputes are nonarbitrable, though the nature and facet of would, to some extent, the level and nature of judicial scrutiny.The restricted and limited review is to check and protect parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably nonarbitrable and to cut off the The court by default would refer the matter when relating to are plainly arguable when consideration in summary proceedings would be and inconclusive when facts are contested when the party opposing arbitration adopts delaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration proceedings.This is not the stage for the court to enter into a mini trial or elaborate review so as to usurp the of the arbitral tribunal but to affirm and uphold integrity and efficacy of arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.6.8 In the case of Vidya Drolia (supra), it is specifically observed and held by this Court that rarely as a the Court may at Section 8 or 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie certain that the arbitration is invalid or the disputes are nonarbitrable, though the nature and facet of non would, to some extent, the level and nature of judicial scrutiny.It is further observed that the restricted and limited review is to check and protect parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably nonarbitrable and to cut off the It is further observed that the prima facie review at the stage is to cut the and trim off the side branches in cases where is barefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and law the must stop at the first stage.Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions and considering Clauses 36 and 37 of the and when a specific plea was taken that the dispute falls within Clause 36 and not under Clause 37 and the dispute is not arbitrable, the High Court was at least required to hold a primary inquiry review and prima facie come to conclusion on whether the dispute falls under Clause 36 or not and whether the dispute is arbitrable or not.Without holding such primary inquiry and despite having observed that a party does have a right to seek of before the Court of law as per Clause 36, has appointed the by solely observing that the same does not bar of disputes through Arbitration and Act, 1996.However, the High Court has not appreciated and considered the fact that in case of dispute as mentioned in Clauses 3, 6 and 9 for of the the dispute is not arbitrable at all.In that view of the matter, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court appointing the is unsustainable and the same to be quashed and set aside.However, at the same time, as the High Court has not held any preliminary inquiry on whether the dispute is arbitrable or not and or whether the dispute falls under Clause 36 or not, we deem it proper to remit the matter to the High Court to hold a preliminary inquiry on the aforesaid in light of the observations made by this Court in the case of Vidya Drolia (supra) and in the case of Indian Oil Limited (supra) and the observations made and pass an order.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Court is the subject matter of present appeals being Civil Appeals Nos.Shri Arijit Prasad and Shri C.N.Sreekumar, learned Senior Advocates have appeared on behalf of the and Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG by Ms.Page 6 of 31 Monica Benjamin, learned counsel has appeared on behalf of the Shri Arijit Prasad, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the in Civil Appeal No.7934/2011 has submitted

submitted that however, there shall not be any levy of penalty under Section 271C of the Act, 1961 on mere late remittance of the TDS though 5.2 It is further submitted by Shri Arijit Prasad, learned

not be any levy of interest under Section 271C of the Act, 1961.5.3 It is submitted that as per the cardinal principle of law, a penal provision is required to be construed strictly and and nothing is

fit to levy the penal interest on late remittance of the TDS for the belated period, there shall not be any levy of the penalty under Section 271C for belated remittance of the TDS.5.5 It is submitted that if the stand taken by the and the views taken by the High Court that even on belated remittance of the TDS there shall be penalty levied under Section 271C of the Act, is accepted, in that case it would to adding something more than which is not provided in the Section.It is submitted that words used Page 10 of 31 in Section 271C are fails to deduct the whole or any part of the tax.It is submitted that it does not speak fails to deduct and remitted belatedly.5.6 Shri Arijit Prasad, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the has drawn our to Section 276B of the Act, 1961.It is

is provided like Section 276B of the Act.It is submitted that thus the words in Section 271C and Section 276B are different and distinct.5.7 It is further submitted by Shri Arijit Prasad, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the that even otherwise, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court has been subsequently overruled by the Full Bench of the Kerala High Court in the case of Lakshadweep Page 12 of 31 Ltd.Vs.

a substantial question of law.5.10 Making the above it is prayed to allow the present appeals and to hold that for late remittance of the TDS, there shall not be any penalty leviable under Section

on behalf of the has submitted that Section 271C of the Act has Page 14 of 31 been inserted in the year 1987.It is submitted that the object and purpose of inserting Section 271C is to levy the penalty for failure to deduct tax at source.It is submitted that under the old provision of Chapter XXI of the Income Tax Act, no penalty was provided for failure to deduct tax at source though, this default, however, prosecution under the provisions of Section 276B, which prescribed punishment for failure to deduct tax at source or after deducting failure to remit the same to the Government and Section 271C came to be inserted to provide for levy of penalty for failure to deduct tax at source.It is submitted that in a case where though the has the tax (TDS), but does not remit the same to the Page 15 of 31 Government and or belatedly remits the TDS after deducting, such an is liable to pay the penalty under Section 271C of the Act.6.2 It is submitted that any other view will frustrate the object and purpose of insertion of Section 271C of the Act.Then, Shri Balbir Singh, learned ASG has taken us to the CBDT Circular No.551 dated 23.01.1998, explaining the amendment and insertion of Section 271C.It is submitted that the object and purpose of insertion of Section 271C seems to be that over and above the prosecution, the person who has tax at source but not remitted the same to the Government shall also be liable to pay penalty and that is why Section 271C has been inserted.Page 16 of 31 6.3 Making the above it is prayed to the present appeals.Heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties at length.7.1 The short question which is posed for the consideration of this Court is in case of belated remittance of the TDS after deducting the TDS whether such an is liable to pay penalty under Section 271C of the Act, 1961?7.2 The question which is also posed for the consideration of this Court is what is the meaning and scope of the words fails to deduct occurring in Section 271C(1)(a) and whether an who caused delay in remittance of TDS by him, can be said a person who fails to deduct TDS?Page 17 of 31 7.3 In order to appreciate the rival and to answer the aforesaid questions, it is necessary to have analysis of provisions.7.4 The relevant provisions are as under Section 201(1A) of the Act Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (1), if any such person, principal officer or company as is to in that subsection does not deduct the whole or any part of the tax or after deducting fails to pay the tax as required by or under this Act, he or it shall be liable to pay simple interest, at one per cent for every month or part of a month on the amount of such tax from the date on which such tax was deductible to the date on which such tax is and at one and onehalf per cent for every month or part of a month on the amount of such tax from the date on which such tax was to the date on which such tax is actually paid, and such interest shall be paid before furnishing the in with the provisions of sub section (3) of Section 200 Section 271C of the Act 271C.Penalty for failure to deduct tax at source.(1) If any person fails to Page 18 of 31 (a) deduct the whole or any part of the tax as required by or under the provisions of Chapter XVIIB or (b) pay the whole or any part of the tax as required by or under, subsection (2) of Section 115O or the second proviso to Section 194B then, such person shall be liable to pay, by way of penalty, a sum equal to the amount of tax which such person failed to deduct or pay as aforesaid.Any penalty imposable under sub section (1) shall be imposed by the Joint Commissioner.Section 273B of the Act 273B.Penalty not to be imposed in certain anything contained in the provisions of clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 271, Section 271A 4203Section 271 AA, Section 271B 4204Section 271 BA, 4205Section 271 BB, 4206Section 271C, Section 271 CA, Section 271D, Section 271 E, 4207Section 271F, 4208Section 271FA 4209, 4210Section 271FAB, Section 271FB, Section 271G, Section 271GA, 4211Section 271 GB, 4212Section 271 H, 4213Section 271I, 4214Section 271J, clause (c) or clause (d) of sub section (1) or subsection (2) of Section 272A, subsection (1) of Section 272 AA or 4215Section 272B or 4216subsection (1) or subsection (1A) of Section 272BB or subsection (1) of Section or clause (b) of subsection (1) or clause (b) or clause (c) of subsection (2) of Section 273, no Page 19 of 31 penalty shall be imposable on the person or the as the case may be, for any failure to in the said provisions if he proves that there was reasonable cause for the said failure.Section 276B of the Act 276B.Failure to pay tax to the credit of Central Government under Chapter XIID or a person fails to pay to the credit of the Central Government, (a) the tax at source by him as required by or under the provisions of Chapter XVIIB or (b) the tax payable by him, as required by or under, subsection (2) of Section 115O or the second proviso to Section 194B, he shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three months but which may extend to seven years and with fine.7.5 At the outset, it is required to be noted that all these cases are with respect to the belated remittance of the TDS though by the and Section 271C(1)(a) shall be applicable.At the cost of repetition, it is observed that it is a case of belated Page 20 of 31 remittance of the TDS though by the and not a case of of TDS at all.7.6 As per Section 271C(1)(a), if any person fails to deduct the whole or any part of the tax as required by or under the provisions of Chapter XVIIB then such a person shall be liable to pay by way of penalty a sum equal to the amount of tax which such person failed to deduct or pay as aforesaid.So far as failure to pay the whole or any part of the tax is concerned, the same would be with respect to Section 271C(1)(b) which is not the case here.Section 271C(1)(a) shall be applicable in case of a failure on the part of the concerned person to deduct the whole of any part of the tax as required by Page 21 of 31 or under the provisions of Chapter XVIIB.The words used in Section 271C(1)(a) are very clear and the relevant words used are fails to deduct.It does not speak about belated remittance of the TDS.As per settled position of law, the penal provisions are required to be construed strictly and As per the cardinal principle of of and more particularly, the penal provision, the penal provisions are required to be read as they are.Nothing is to be or nothing is to be taken out of the penal provision.on plain reading of Section 271C of the Act, 1961, there shall not be penalty leviable on belated remittance of the TDS after the same is by the Section 271C of the Income Tax Act is quite categoric.Its scope and extent of application Page 22 of 31 is discernible from the provision itself, in terms.When the non deduction of the whole or any part of the tax, as required by or under the various instances provisions of Chapter XVIIB would invite penalty under Clause 271C(1)(a) only a limited text, involving subsection (2) of Section 115O or covered by the second proviso to Section 194B alone would an instance where penalty can be imposed in terms of Section 271C(1)(b) of the Act, namely, on It is not for the Court to read something more into it, contrary to the intent and legislative wisdom.7.7 At this stage, it is required to be noted that the Parliament wanted to have the of and or belated remittance payment of the TDS, the Page 23 of 31 Parliament Legislature has provided the same like in Section 201(1A) and Section 276B of the Act.7.8 Section 201(1A) provides that in case a tax has been at source but the same is subsequently remitted may be belatedly or after some days, such a person is liable to pay the interest as provided under Section 201(1A) of the Act.The levy of interest under Section 201(1A) thus can be said to be compensatory in nature on belated remittance of the TDS after deducting the same.of non payment belated remittance payment of the TDS are specifically provided under Section 201(1A).7.9 Similarly, Section 276B talks about the prosecution on failure to pay the TDS after Page 24 of 31 deducting the same.At this stage, it is required to be noted that Section 271C has been amended subsequently in the year 1997 providing Sections 271C(1)(a) and 271C(1)(b).As observed fails to pay the whole or any part of the tax would be falling under Section 271C(1)(b) and the word used 271C(1)(a) and 271C(1)(b) is or.At this stage, it is required to be noted that Section 276B provides for prosecution in case of failure to pay tax to the credit of Central Government.The word pay is missing in Section 271C(1)(a).Now so far as the reliance placed upon the CBDTs Circular No.551 dated 23.01.1998 by learned ASG is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that the said circular as such favours the Circular No.551 Page 25 of 31 deals with the under which Section 271C was introduced in the for levy of penalty.16.5 of the above Circular reads as follows 16.5 Insertion of a new section 271C to provide for levy of penalty for failure to deduct tax at source under the old provisions of Chapter XXI of the Income Tax Act no penalty was provided for failure to deduct tax at source.This default, however, prosecution under the provisions of Section 276B, which prescribed punishment for failure to deduct tax at source or after deducting failure to pay the same to the Government.It was that the first part of the default, i.e., failure to deduct tax at source should be made liable to levy of penalty, while the second part of the default, i.e., failure to pay the tax at source to the Government which is a more serious offence, should continue to prosecution.The Amending Act, 1987 has accordingly inserted a new Section 271C to provide for of penalty on any person who fails to deduct tax at source as required under the provisions of Chapter XVIIB of the Act.The penalty is of a sum equal to the Page 26 of 31 amount of tax which should have been at source.On fair reading of said CBDTs circular, it talks about the levy of penalty on failure to deduct tax at source.It also takes note of the fact that if there is any delay in remitting the tax, it will payment of

deduct the tax at source, it may lead to loss of and hence remedial measures have been provided by incorporating the provision to ensure that tax to the said extent would stand shifted to the shoulders of the party who failed to effect deduction, in the form of penalty.On Page 27 of 31 deduction of tax, if there is delay in remitting the amount to it has to be satisfied with interest as payable under Section 201(1A) of the Act, besides the to face the prosecution proceedings, if launched in cases, in terms of Section 276B of the Act.Even the CBDT has taken note of the fact that no penalty is envisaged under Section 271C of the Income Tax Act for non deduction TDS and no penalty is envisaged under Section 271C for belated remittance payment deposit of the TDS.8.1 Even otherwise, the words fails to deduct occurring in Section 271C(1)(a) cannot be read into failure to deposit pay the tax Page 28 of 31 8.2 on true of Section 271C, there shall not be any penalty leviable under Section 271C on mere delay in remittance of the TDS after deducting the same by the concerned As observed the on non payment belated remittance of the TDS would be under Section 201(1A) and Section 276B of the Act, 1961.In view of the above in all these cases as the remitted the TDS though belatedly and it is not case of of the TDS at all they are no liable to pay the penalty under Section 271C of the Income Tax Act.any question on Page 29 of 31 of Section 273B of the Act is not required to be considered any

Supreme_Court_2024_51,"VIKRAM NATH, J.The rule of Judicial and Propriety and the Doctrine of has a merit of promoting certainty and consistency in judicial decisions providing assurance to as to the of their actions.The benches of this court have time and again the rules emerging from Judicial Accordingly, when a decision of a coordinate Bench of same High court is brought to the notice of the bench, it is to be and is binding subject to right of the bench of Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by such co-equal quorum to take a different view Neetu Khajuria and refer the question to a larger bench.It is the Date IST Reason Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 1 of 16 only course of action open to a bench of co-equal strength, when faced with the previous decision taken by a bench with same strength.The plaintiff is in appeal assailing the correctness of the judgment and order dated passed by the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court, whereby, the Second Appeal filed by the was allowed, the judgment and passed by the Sub-Judge, dated was set aside and that of the Trial Court dated 30.06.1997 was restored and confirmed.The appellant a civil suit for declaration of title, and permanent against the respondents which was as OS No.308 of 1995 in the Court of District Magistrate at Eraniel.The basis for filing the suit was that earlier in 1976, the respondents had filed a suit for of the appellant which was as OS No.70 of 1976.The said suit was First Appeal was and Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 2 of 16 the Second Appeal was also by the High Court, vide judgment dated The same became final as it was not carried any further.The appellant continued in of the property in suit.However, as the respondents were trying to with the of the appellant, she filed the suit.The respondents contested the suit and filed their written According to them, the taken was that they had purchased 8 cents of land by way of sale deed on 13.03.1974 which was with respect to an open piece of land and did not contain any building as such.The suit of 1976 filed by them was with respect to the constructions raised by the appellant and not with respect to 8 cents of land.The appellant had no right, title or interest over the suit property.The suit was liable to be The Trial Court framed the following six Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 3 of 16 (i).Whether the suit property properly absolutely belongs to the plaintiffs?(ii).Whether the decision of the Honourable High Court of Madras in S.A. No.2082/1990 relates to the entire 8 cents of the suit property or whether it pertains to the house in a portion of the suit property?Whether the plaintiffs have been in and enjoyment of the entire suit property?(iv).Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief of permanent as prayed for?(v).Whether the suit property is to be demarcated and northern boundary is put up as prayed for?(vi).What reliefs are the Plaintiffs entitled to?Issue No.2 related to the question whether the judgment of the High Court in Second Appeal No.2082 of 1990 related to the entire 8 cents of the property or whether it pertained only to the house in a portion of the land in dispute.Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 4 of 16 The Trial Court, vide judgement dated 30.06.1997, the suit for declaration of title, and permanent but only with respect to the portion over which the house property was situated out of the total extent of 8 cents of the suit property.With respect to the other property, the suit was Aggrieved by the of the suit, the appellant an Appeal which was as Appeal No.169 of 1997.The Sub- Judge vide judgement dated modified the judgement and of the Trial Court and declared that the appellants were entitled for the entire suit property for relief of declaration of title, permanent and for setting up their boundary for securing the said property.The learned Sub-Judge had mainly relied upon the judgment of the High Court dated in the earlier round of Aggrieved by the judgment of the Sub-Judge, the respondents second appeal before the Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 5 of 16 High Court as Second Appeal No.451 of 2004.The High Court, by the impugned judgment dated allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Sub-Judge and restored the of the Trial Court.Aggrieved by the same, the plaintiff has the present appeal.Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record.The main argument advanced on behalf of the appellant is that the High Court in the first round in its judgment dated had specifically recorded that the dispute was with respect to 8 cents of land and the construction standing thereon.The Trial Court or the High Court in the present round of could not have confined it only to the construction and not the entire portion of land measuring 8 cents.It is further submitted that under the law of merger, the judgment of the Trial Court and the First Appeal Court in the first round of merged with the judgment of the High Court Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 6 of 16 dated and it is that judgment alone which has to be read as final and binding the parties.It is also submitted that the First Appeal Court in its judgement dated in the present round had specifically recorded that the Trial Court had no to go against the judgement of the High Court.The High Court in its impugned judgement has in fact breached the judicial by taking a view contrary to the earlier judgement.On the other hand, learned Counsel for the respondents submitted that the judgements of the Trial Court and the High Court in the present round is correct in law and facts.The earlier round of by the respondents was only with respect to the constructions raised by the appellant which of course they had lost.The respondents had throughout been in of the 8 cents of land.The appellants were never in thereof.The judgement of the Trial Court and that of the High Court to be maintained.Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 7 of 16 In the judgement of the High Court in the first round dated it is not at one place but at number of places that the High Court has recorded that the suit property comprised of 8 cents of land which was the land purchased by the respondents in 1974.It would be relevant to refer to such facts noted in the said judgment.In the opening the High Court mentioned as follows The suit property is consisting of 8 cents.The defendant was residing in this property even prior to the purchase of this property by the plaintiff.Then again in no.2, the High Court records as follows The learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the suit property is comprised of 8 cents of land and the appellant purchased the same by a sale deed dated 13.03.1974, which is marked as Exhibit A-1.The above clearly shows that not only the High Court notes that it was 8 cents of land which was in dispute Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 8 of 16 but also the Counsel for the appellants therein (respondents herein) whose are recorded understood it in the same manner.Again, in no.3, the High Court records as follows In the sale deed dated 13.03.1974 (Exhibit A1) there is no mention about the in which the respondent herein is residing.The sale deed merely states about the sale of 8 cents of land.As already stated, that the respondent was residing in the suit property even prior to the purchase by the appellant.Lastly, the High Court records its finding as follows The courts below found that all the documents produced by the respondent herein are in the name of the respondent.considering all these documents, the courts below came to the conclusion that the respondent herein is in of the suit property for more than the period and so she had her title by adverse In the light of the above facts, arguments and findings recorded by the High Court in its judgment dated apparently no Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 9 of 16 was left for the respondents to take as it was already held that the appellant had her rights by adverse over the suit property which was 8 cents of land.The construction of the appellant was standing over the 8 cents of land may be on part of it but she was found in of the entire 8 cents.The respondents never sought any of the findings of the High Court or the observations made therein nor did they assail the same before any higher forum.The judgement dated attained finality.Interpreting the said judgement which was clear in itself any differently would clearly amount to judicial The Sub-Judge in its judgement dated had rightly observed that the Trial Court had no to interpret the judgement of the High Court dated in any other way than what was recorded therein.The doctrine of merger is a common law doctrine that is rooted in the idea of of the decorum of hierarchy of courts and tribunals.Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 10 of 16 The doctrine is based on the simple reasoning that there cannot be, at the same time, more than one operative order governing the same subject matter.The same was aptly summed up by this Court when it described the said doctrine in Kunhayammed Ors.v. State of Kerala Anr.1 44 (i) Where an appeal or revision is provided against an order passed by a court, tribunal or any other authority before superior forum and such superior forum modifies, or affirms the decision put in issue before it, the decision by the subordinate forum merges in the decision by the superior forum and it is the latter which remains operative and is capable of in the eye of the Law.The legal position on Coordinate Benches has further been elaborated by this Court in State of Punjab Anr.v. Devans Modern Ltd. Anr.2 Judicial envisages that a coordinate Bench follow the decision of an earlier coordinate Bench.If a coordinate Bench does not agree with the principles of law enunciated by another Bench, the 6 SCC 359 (2004) 11 SCC 26 Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 11 of 16 matter may be only to a larger Bench.In Halsburys Laws of England (4th Edn.), Vol.26 at pp.297-98, para 578, it is stated A decision is given per incuriam when the court has acted in ignorance of a previous decision of its own or of a court of coordinate which covered the case before it, in which case it must decide which case to follow.We have already about the importance of ensuring judicial and the same has also been upheld by various judgement of this Court.In Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community Anr.vs. State of Anr.3, this Court has summed up the legal position of rules of judicial as follows 12.The law laid down by this Court in a decision by a Bench of larger strength is binding on any subsequent Bench of lesser or coequal strength.A Bench of lesser quorum cannot disagree or dissent from the view of the law taken by a Bench of larger quorum.In case of doubt all that the Bench of lesser quorum can do is to invite the of the Chief Justice and request for the (2005) 2 SCC 673 Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 12 of 16 matter being placed for hearing before a Bench of larger quorum than the Bench whose decision has come up for consideration.It will be open only for a Bench of coequal strength to express an opinion doubting the correctness of the view taken by the earlier Bench of coequal strength, whereupon the matter may be placed for hearing before a Bench consisting of a quorum larger than the one which pronounced the decision laying down the law the correctness of which is doubted.In the current case, as previously mentioned, the High Courts judgment from the round dated noted that the disputed property included 8 cents of land, not just the building structure on it.As per the Doctrine of Merger, the judgments of the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court from the first round of are absorbed into the High Courts judgment dated This 1990 judgment should be regarded as the conclusive and binding order from the Following the principles of judicial lower or subordinate Courts do not have the authority to contradict the decisions of higher Courts.In the Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 13 of 16 current case, the Trial Court and the High Court, in the second round of violated this judicial by adopting a position contrary to the High Courts final judgment dated from the first round of The argument of the Counsel for respondents is mainly that the judgment of the Trial Court and First Appellate Court in the first round of clearly stated in the case of the plaintiff that it was with respect to the constructed portion only in which the mother of the appellant was residing and not the whole area of 8 cents purchased by them.The High Court committed a bona fide in recording that the suit property was 8 cents along with constructions standing over it.As such the Trial Court and the High Court in the present round were correct in the only to the constructions and not the entire area of 8 cents.In order to test the above we carefully examined the judgement of the Trial Court as also the First Appellate Court.What is Civil Appeal No.9941 of 2016 Page 14 of 16 discernible is that nowhere it is recorded the actual boundary or the of the property in of the mother of the appellant (defendant therein).The respondents- plaintiff therein had based her case on the ground that they had purchased 8 cents of open piece of land and the defendant therein had raised construction over some adjoining land, and had over part of her purchased land as such of be granted.We are unable to appreciate the said argument of the respondents.Suit for has to describe the property in question with and all details of and boundaries.This was completely lacking.A suit for with respect to such a property would be liable to be on the ground of its Further, it may be noted that if the construction by the defendant were not made over 8 cents of purchased land, then the plaintiff therein would not have a claim to of the same.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
